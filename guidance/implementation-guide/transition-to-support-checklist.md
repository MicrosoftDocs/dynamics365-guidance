# Checklist for transitioning to support for your Dynamics 365 implementation projects

## Support scope

|Done?  |Task  |
|---------|---------|
|&check;|Establish a practical reference architecture and detailed procedures with repeatable steps for the support team that can be operated day to day.|
|&check;|Identify the impact of the business and IT policies on the scope and the impact on the policies after the Dynamics 365 application is in operation.|
|&check;|Identify the Dynamics 365 application-specific functions and procedures as well as business processes that need to be supported.|

## Support model and the related support organization

|Done?  |Task  |
|---------|---------|
|&check;|Define the type of support operating model to adopt and the nature of the role of the internal and external support teams.|
|&check;|Create a support organization charter with a detailed definition of the tasks, roles, responsibilities, and standards expected to keep the system operating.|
|&check;|Consider the implications of supporting a cloud and SaaS application, and potentially including a Dynamics 365 Centre of Excellence (CoE) in the support model.|

## Support operational considerations

|Done?  |Task  |
|---------|---------|
|&check;|Establish a transition strategy that drives the support team to participate in the emerging solution and improve their support readiness over the project lifecycle, rather than a limited handover close to go live.|
|&check;|Confirm the readiness of the support team's operating model, resources, knowledge, and procedures during UAT.|
|&check;|Have a defined strategy to manage the critical period just after going live (hyper care) with explicit entry and exit criteria.|
|&check;|Define how to keep the solution up to date and evolving with additional and improved features and capabilities.|
|&check;|Determine a support and servicing calendar for regular and periodic maintenance activities.|
|&check;|Identify the normal hours of operation across different locations, as well as out-of-hours service windows, multi-language and time zone requirements, seasonal peaks, period-end, or one-off events.|
|&check;|Establish formal escalation procedures with defined criteria, SLAs, and different tiers of support, including internal and external support.|
|&check;|Determine the tooling that the support organization requires.|
|&check;|Identify the policies to access data and environments, either by internal support teams or by external support teams.|

## Next steps

- Review how to construct a strategy to help you prepare, define, and operate a support model in the section [overview](transition-to-support.md)
- Learn about the importance of defining the [support scope](transition-to-support-scope.md)
- Understand key aspects when deciding on [support models](transition-to-support-models.md)
- Uncover the requirements related to [support operations](transition-to-support-operations.md)
- Read the [case study](service-solution-case-study.md) to understand the need to develop and continually audit an organization's support strategy in the cloud world
