# Overview of end-to-end scenarios and business processes in Dynamics 365

Dynamics 365 supports many different industries and types of organizations. In this section, we provide an overview of end-to-end scenarios that organizations often look for. Dynamics 365 is a suite of applications that are designed to help organizations meet the organizational goals aligned to various business processes in specific industries.  

[!INCLUDE [daf-business-process-def](~/../shared-content/shared/guidance-includes/daf-business-process-def.md)] In our articles, we illustrate this sequence of steps in flowcharts.
