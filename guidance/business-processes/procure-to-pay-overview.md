***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Microsoft Supply Chain Center***

This article describes the *procure to pay* end-to-end business process flow and its relationship to other business processes that can be used within Dynamics 365.

## Procure to pay process relationship

The following diagram shows the relationship of other processes for the *procure to pay* process.

:::image type="content" source="media/procure-to-pay-process.png" alt-text="forecast to plan process relationship diagram." lightbox="media/procure-to-pay-process.png":::

The upstream process for the *procure to pay* processes are:

- **Forecast to plan**  

  Supply and demand forecasts will be included during the *plan supply* subprocess before procuring materials and services to meet your internal and external customer needs.

- **Order to cash**  

  The *Demand from sales orders* subprocess will be used during the *plan supply* subprocess to procure the requested materials or services. Tt could also include related components of an ordered finished good being produced.

- **Design to retire**  

  This end-to-end process is a mandatory prerequisite before you can procure materials and services for your organization. It must be completed before you step into the *procure to pay* process.

- **Project to profit**  

  Materials and services included to support an ongoing project will be included in the *plan supply* subprocess.

- **Prospect to quote**  

  Materials and services requested during the quotation process will be used during the supply planning process to procure the requested products or services.

The second column in the diagram displays the following business processes areas:

- *Manage vendor relationships*

- *Develop sourcing strategies*

- *Define procurement catalogs*

- *Define policies and procedures for procurement*

- *Plan supply*

- *Procure materials and services*

- *Process vendor invoices*

- *Issue and settle vendor payments*

- *Manage vendor debits and chargebacks*

- *Create and process promissory notes*

- *Process vendor rebates and incentives*

- *Analyze vendor performance*

Learn more at [Procure to pay business process areas](procure-to-pay-areas.md).

The third column in the diagram displays the downstream business process including the following list:

- **Acquire to dispose**  

  Purchased assets will be tracked within the *acquire to dispose* business process.

- **Case to resolution**  

  The *case to resolution* process may be used to track and report issues with materials, services, or vendors for corrective actions while implementing continuous improvements.

- **Forecast to plan**  

  Material forecasts will be used during the *forecast to plan* business process to ensure needed materials are purchased to support supply and demand needs. Once the plan is reviewed, the materials will be purchased based on the inventory quantities requested.

- **Inventory to deliver**  

  Once materials are purchased, the materials will be managed in the *inventory to deliver* business process that will include the receiving and material movements processes.

- **Order to cash**

  Materials and services will be planned and purchased to fulfill orders that have arrived within the *order to cash* business process. It would include orders where materials are shipped directly from the vendor to the end customer.

- **Plan to produce**  

  Materials purchased will be used during the *plan to produce* business process when producing finished goods. It may also include materials and services purchased during the subcontracting or contract manufacturing processes when an outside vendor is used in the production process.

- **Project to profit**  

  Purchased materials and services to support ongoing projects will be used within the *project to profit* business process.

- **Record to report**

  After the materials and services are purchased, the *record to report* business process will be used to record any invoices, vendor debits and chargeback, and vendor payments.

- **Service to cash**  

  To support the *service to cash* business process, materials or services may need to be purchased to support internal and external activities such as maintenance, installation, or warranty services.

### Featured capabilities

There are product-specific capabilities that interact with the *procure to pay* processing including, but not limited to:

- **Vendor collaboration**  

  This optional module in Dynamics 365 provides a portal to interact with vendors on purchase orders, RFQ (request for quotes), consignment inventory, invoices, and other master data. The option is available if EDI (Electronic data interchange) isn't used for procurement.

- **Vendor onboarding**  

  Vendors can request to onboard through a customer-hosted site that allows anonymous access. The vendor fills in request information that is then imported as a prospective vendor request in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management for review. Out-of-the-box workflows allow the customer to control the vendors that are approved for onboarding and created within the vendor master. Once the vendor is created in Dynamics 365, the vendor can be set up to use the vendor collaboration portal as mentioned above.

- **Microsoft Supply Chain Center**  

  You can synchronize your data from first party applications or third-party applications to the Dataverse to use advanced analytics capabilities for monitoring your supply chain.

- **Purchasing policies**  

  Purchasing policies allow your organization to have a set of rules around the requisition and purchasing processes while using the built-in workflow capabilities.

- **Quality management**  

  This capability in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management provides a framework to capture nonconforming materials through product testing. Users can set the timing for when to generate a quality order for testing before materials are released for consumption. With the gathered data surrounding the item sampling or tests completed, results can assist with corrective action, should it be needed.

- **Dynamics 365 Finance Invoice Capture**  

  This solution can automatically create vendor invoices using OCR to translate the received vendor invoice into an electronic document for processing. It's helpful in improving accuracy and processing times while reducing manual intervention.

- **Advanced warehouse management (mobile device)**  

  During the *materials receipt* process in the *Inventory to deliver* end-to-end scenario, you can use warehouse management processes to automate and simplify the inventory processes on the warehouse floor with mobile devices.Â  

## Procure to pay business process flow

The following diagram shows the high-level flow of the *procure to pay* business process. [!INCLUDE [daf-business-process-e2e-flow-def](~/../shared-content/shared/guidance-includes/daf-business-process-e2e-flow-def.md)]

:::image type="content" source="media/procure-to-pay-flow.png" alt-text="Flow diagram for the end-to-end business process, procure to pay, which is explained in the paragraph after the image." lightbox="media/procure-to-pay-flow.png":::

The following steps are illustrated in the *procure to pay* end-to-end business process flow diagram.

1. Start

2. *Procure to pay* end-to-end process

    Parallel subprocesses include the following processes:

    1. *Manage vendor relationships*

    2. *Develop sourcing strategies*

    3. *Define procurement catalogs*

    4. *Define policies and procedures for procurement*
