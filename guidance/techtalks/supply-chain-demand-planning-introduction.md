# TechTalk: Demand Planning for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

In the dynamic world of supply chain management, staying ahead in forecasting and demand planning is crucial. The introduction of advanced demand planning capabilities within Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management is set to revolutionize this domain. These capabilities, freshly announced and currently in public preview, bring a new level of precision and flexibility to supply chain operations.

We've based this article on [a TechTalk](https://www.youtube.com/embed/3fTK02OKS\_o?si=P3Wpbp-ZDfhk2iyV) that you can find online in the Dynamics 365 channel on YouTube.

## Data import and transformation

The journey in enhancing demand planning begins with the seamless integration of data. This system allows for the importation of historical data from a multitude of sources such as Azure Data Lake and CSV files. This inclusive approach extends to businesses not currently using Finance and Operations (FNO) systems, widening the scope of who can benefit from these tools.

Once the data is collated, it undergoes a transformation phase. Here, the raw data is methodically structured into daily, weekly, or monthly segments. This reorganization is pivotal for simplifying complex datasets into more manageable forms for analysis.

### Establishing data relationships

A notable feature is the ability to create relationships between various data tables. This ensures a unified and comprehensive dataset, ready for the subsequent stages of forecasting and analysis.

## Advanced forecasting capabilities

## Utilizing various forecasting models

The heart of the demand planning app lies in its forecasting capabilities. The app employs advanced models like Arima, ETS, and Profit, offering a range of choices for businesses to find the model that best suits their data. The 'best fit' option is a standout feature, analyzing the effectiveness of each model on the data and suggesting the most optimized solution.

## Integration with custom algorithms

For businesses with pre-existing forecasting models, the app provides the flexibility to integrate these custom algorithms. This ensures that previous investments in machine learning and data analysis continue to add value.

## Collaborative review and adjustment

A critical component of demand planning is the ability to review and adjust forecasts. The app facilitates this by enabling teams to collaborate effectively. It allows adjustments at both granular and aggregate levels and offers the management of different forecast versions.

## Exporting and utilizing data

The final step in the demand planning process is exporting the data. This feature is crucial as it allows the refined forecasts to be exported back into Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management or other formats, ensuring practical application in supply chain execution.

## Looking ahead: the roadmap

The roadmap for the Demand Planning app is filled with promising developments, including cell commenting for collaborative adjustments, role-level access for user-specific experiences, and special features for new product introductions. The app also plans to introduce copilot experiences for enriched user interactions.

To assist users in maximizing the potential of this app, a variety of resources are available. These include instructional videos, tutorials, and comprehensive documentation on the Dynamics 365 for Supply Chain Management Learn page. Community engagement through customer sign-up forms and Yammer groups is encouraged for feedback and shared learning. An upcoming workshop in Copenhagen offers an in-depth exploration of the app's capabilities and future direction.

## Conclusion

The new demand planning capabilities within Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management represent a significant advancement in supply chain forecasting and management. With its comprehensive process, ranging from data integration to practical application, coupled with upcoming enhancements, this tool is poised to become a cornerstone in modern supply chain operations.
