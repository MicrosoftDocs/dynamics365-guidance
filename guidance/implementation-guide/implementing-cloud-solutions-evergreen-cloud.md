# Keep up with technology using Dynamics 365

A modern cloud solution lets you run your business on the latest version of the service. It's the only way to scale, and it's how Dynamics 365 works. Microsoft takes care of updating the platform for you. You don't have to spend time and money on traditional upgrades that offer little value for your business. Instead, the evergreen approach and the model of continuous updates gives you continuous access to new features and improvements that help you stay ahead of the competition and meet changing customer needs.

Dynamics 365 delivers updates in a way that benefits you without disrupting your work. The updates follow the continuous integration/continuous development (CI/CD) model, which means they happen weekly, but they don't affect the user experience. You can also preview and test upcoming changes before they go live. We balance the need to provide you with the best capabilities and the need to avoid interrupting your operations. That's our evergreen cloud approach.

To learn more about how we update the service, read the article [Service the solution](service-solution.md).
