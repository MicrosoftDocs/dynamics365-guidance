# Manage product pricing overview

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Business Central, Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

This article describes how you can use Dynamics 365 to manage pricing and discounts for tangible products that are offered to customers and bought from suppliers.

Managing product pricing is a pivotal aspect of organizational success, influencing profitability and competitive positioning. In today's dynamic business landscape, effective product pricing requires a comprehensive approach, and when using the suite of Dynamics 365 products organizations can achieve these goals. From Dynamics 365 Commerce to Customer Service, Field Service, Project Operations, Sales, and Supply Chain Management, these interconnected tools provide a robust framework for optimizing product pricing strategies.

Dynamics 365 enables organizations to seamlessly align pricing structures with market demands and competitive landscapes, fostering transparent relationships with clients. The suite facilitates agile responses to dynamic market changes, ensuring adaptability and strategic refinement to stay ahead. Specifically, in Dynamics 365 Commerce, businesses can apply advanced pricing models for both business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C) scenarios, across channels such as online, in store, and in the back office, enhancing their merchandising strategies and delivering personalized pricing experiences to diverse customer segments.

The process of managing product pricing involves a series of interconnected business processes crucial for organizational efficiency. Beginning with the definition of a robust product catalog and strategy, organizations can introduce new products seamlessly, strategically positioning them in the market. The management of product pricing involves meticulous determination of prices and eligibility for discounts, ensuring offerings align with market demands.

Simultaneously, defining product costing becomes paramount for maintaining profitability. The holistic approach extends to managing the entire product lifecycle, from introduction to retirement, ensuring continuous refinement and strategic adaptation. This integrated process within Dynamics 365 empowers organizations to navigate the complexities of product pricing with agility and foresight, contributing to sustained success.

In an organization focused on products, especially when downstream processes such as procure to pay, prospect to quote, order to cash, plan to produce, project to profit, case to resolution, service to cash, and/or record to report are part of the Dynamics 365 implementation, early consideration of business processes related to managing product pricing is essential.

The data and output of these processes impact various downstream operations and defining them early in the project ensures overall project success. If Dynamics 365 won't serve as the system of record for product data, integrations to the designated system should be considered early in the planning phase.

## Stakeholders

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of the *manage product pricing* area. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

- **Product pricing stakeholders** include pricing analysts and product managers. Pricing analysts play a key role in analyzing market trends and competitive pricing, contributing valuable insights to shape effective product pricing strategies. Product managers collaborate in determining the value proposition of products and aligning pricing structures with perceived value.

- **Sales and merchandising stakeholders** include sales managers, merchandisers, and retail analysts. Sales managers provide insights into customer preferences, helping tailor promotional pricing for optimal sales performance. Merchandisers collaborate to enhance the merchandising strategy, applying pricing models for both B2B and B2C scenarios.

- **Finance and costing stakeholders** include cost accountants and financial planners. Cost accountants analyze product costing structures, ensuring alignment with profitability goals. Financial planners contribute to the financial analysis of product pricing, assessing its impact on profit margins and financial health.

- **Product lifecycle management stakeholders** include product lifecycle managers and operations managers. These roles are instrumental in managing the entire product lifecycle, from introduction to retirement, ensuring that pricing strategies are adapted to different phases and market demands.

- **Customer feedback and satisfaction stakeholders** include customer success managers and feedback analysts. Customer success managers provide valuable feedback based on customer interactions, contributing to the continuous improvement of pricing strategies. Feedback analysts analyze customer reviews and sentiments to refine pricing approaches.

- **Regulatory and compliance stakeholders** include compliance officers and external auditors. Compliance officers ensure that product pricing strategies align with regulatory requirements and industry standards. External auditors provide an independent assessment of compliance, offering insights into potential risks and improvements.
