***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Finance***

This article describes the order to cash end-to-end business process flow and its relationship to other business processes in Dynamics 365.

## Order to cash process relationships

The following diagram shows the relationship of the end-to-end order to cash process with other upstream and downstream processes.

:::image type="content" source="media/order-to-cash-process-relationship.svg" alt-text="List of upstream and downstream processes in relation to the order to cash process." lightbox="media/order-to-cash-process-relationship.svg":::

The order to cash process has the following potential upstream processes:

- **Case to resolution**: When you use Dynamics 365 Customer Service to handle customer inquiries, the case may lead to a sale.

- **Forecast to plan**: In some operational strategies, such as make to stock or buy to stock, the forecast to plan processes occur before order to cash.

- **Plan to produce**: In some operational strategies, such as make to stock, the production order is completed before orders take place.

- **Design to retire**: In some operational strategies, such as make to stock or purchase to stock, the products to be sold are defined before orders are placed. This is especially true for retail organizations with a brick-and-mortar presence.

- **Prospect to quote**: In some operational strategies, such as make to order and engineer to order, the prospect to quote processes occur before order to cash, since they trigger the process.

The order to cash end-to-end process comprises the following [business process areas](order-to-cash-areas-overview.md):

- Manage store operations
- Create and manage sales orders
- Issue customer invoices
- Record customer payments
- Monitor customer credit and collections

The order to cash process has the following downstream processes:

- **Case to resolution**: The case to resolution process is often used to handle inquiries and issues with sales orders, including the returns and exchange process. In some industries, the case to resolution process is used to handle product recalls.

- **Forecast to plan**: In some operational strategies, such as make to order and engineer to order, the forecasting processes typically occur after orders are placed, since they trigger planning purchases and production.

- **Inventory to deliver**: After orders are placed, they must be fulfilled. The inventory to deliver process includes all the steps for picking and packing, including shipment and transportation planning and scheduling steps for delivering orders. It also includes inventory movements and transfers to meet supply chain requirements for orders to retail stores.

- **Plan to produce**: In some operational strategies, such as make to order and engineer to order, the forecasting processes typically occur after orders are placed, since they trigger planning production.

- **Procure to pay**: In some operational strategies, such as make to order and engineer to order, the forecasting processes typically occur after orders are placed, since they trigger planning purchases. When you use a direct delivery sales model, the sales order is also the trigger to initiate the purchase order with the supplier.

- **Design to retire**: In engineer-to-order operational strategies, products and services are typically defined after an order is placed.

- **Record to report**: Processing sales orders has a financial impact on inventory, revenue, and cost of goods sold. These effects are recorded in the general ledger and reported as part of the record to report process.

## Featured capabilities

The order to cash process interacts with the following product-specific capabilities, among others:

- **Point of sale**: Dynamics 365 Commerce includes a cloud-based point of sale with a modern interface, which supports all brick-and-mortar operations.

The demand forecasting capability uses historical demand data and Azure Machine Learning to generate a statistical forecast, which can be collaboratively reviewed and published for use in planning activities.
