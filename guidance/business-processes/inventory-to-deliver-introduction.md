### Increased customer satisfaction

With a well-defined *inventory to deliver* process, Dynamics 365 can increase customer satisfaction by providing real-time visibility into inventory levels and delivery status. All transactions throughout Dynamics 365 including sales, purchases, production, and other inventory movements, for example, are updated in real-time. By using the inventory management tools in Dynamics 365, such as planning optimization, the product information management module, and robust reporting and analytics capabilities, businesses can ensure they have the right products in stock to fulfill orders, avoid stockouts, and provide accurate delivery estimates to customers. The system can also automatically generate notifications to customers when orders are shipped, giving them visibility into their order status and improving the overall customer experience. With Dynamics 365, businesses can streamline their inventory management and order fulfillment processes, leading to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.

### Reduced inventory costs

By accurately forecasting demand and automating inventory management with Dynamics 365, businesses can optimize inventory levels, reduce stockouts, and minimize overstocking. Such benefits lead to lower carrying costs, fewer stock losses due to obsolescence or expiration, and lower costs associated with inventory holding, handling, and storage. Dynamics 365 can also help organizations improve supply chain efficiency by streamlining vendor management, reducing lead times, and improving order fulfillment accuracy. By reducing inventory costs, organizations can improve their bottom line and pass on the cost savings to their customers, thus enhancing customer satisfaction.

### Improved cash flow

A well-defined *inventory to deliver* process, supported by Dynamics 365, can improve cash flow in several ways.  

1. By optimizing inventory levels, organizations can reduce the amount of cash tied up in excess inventory. Better inventory management helps make sure they have the right amount of inventory on hand to meet demand while minimizing the amount of capital required to maintain that inventory.  
2. By streamlining warehouse and transportation operations with the Dynamics 365 Warehouse management and Transportation management modules, companies can reduce lead times and improve order fulfillment, which can lead to faster payment and improved cash flow.  
3. Dynamics 365 can provide real-time visibility into inventory levels and order status, enabling organizations to make informed decisions that improve cash flow. The system can also automate invoice generation and payment tracking, reducing administrative time and increasing efficiency. Overall, a well-executed *inventory to deliver* process supported by Dynamics 365 can help organizations optimize inventory and order fulfillment, leading to improved cash flow and financial performance.  
4. Dynamics 365 Finance also includes a robust cash flow forecasting feature that uses artificial intelligence to provide real-time visibility into the cash flow for an organization to monitor the cash flow across the organization that integrates seamlessly with Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. Similarly, you can analyze your organization's cash flow in Dynamics 365 Business Central.

### Increased overall business performance

By having greater visibility and control over inventory levels, organizations can optimize their operations to better meet customer demand and avoid excess inventory costs. Improved inventory management can lead to faster order fulfillment times, which can help increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. The result might be higher sales revenue and better cash flow, and improved inventory turnover ratios. By using Dynamics 365 to manage their *inventory to deliver* process, organizations can ultimately improve their bottom line and overall business performance.

### Reduce the risk of stockouts, overstocks, and excess inventory

Dynamics 365 provides real-time visibility into inventory levels and demand forecasts, which enables businesses to make informed decisions about when and how much to order. With Microsoft Supply Chain Center, your team can get tailored information from external sources, including supplier-related information, news and more from artificial intelligence delivered in a dashboard that is easy to use and react to supply chain disruptions. This information helps prevent stockouts, which can result in lost sales and dissatisfied customers, while also reducing the risk of overstocks and excess inventory, which tie up capital and increase holding costs. Additionally, the solution can help identify slow-moving items and enable organizations to adjust their ordering and stocking strategies, accordingly, reducing the likelihood of excess inventory. Overall, an effective *inventory to deliver* process supported by Dynamics 365 can help organizations optimize inventory levels, reduce the risk of stockouts and overstocks, and improve overall business performance.
