# Integrate your Dynamics 365 apps with other solutions

Dynamics 365 apps offer a rich and mature set of features for various industries. But sometimes you might want to extend your processes or use data from other sources. In this article, you'll learn how to connect your Dynamics 365 apps with other solutions or with each other. Other articles in this section offer guidance on how to choose a platform, design, and pattern for your integration project and the challenges and best practices for integrating different Dynamics 365 apps.

## Define your business goals

Before you start integrating systems, you should [define your goals from a business perspective](integrate-other-solutions-business-goals.md). This will help you make sure that your integration work supports the overall direction of the business. You should match each requirement of cross-system processes against the goals of the project and the business.

## Choose a platform

Data storage needs have grown exponentially in recent years and will continue to do so. The amount of data that's generated and transferred today is huge. Along with new data that your organization captures or generates, you might need to preserve historical data from legacy systems, too. [Choose a platform](integrate-other-solutions-choose-platform.md) that will handle the storage and transfer of large amounts of data reliably.

## Choose a design

Many factors influence how you [choose a design](integrate-other-solutions-choose-design.md) for your integration. You can group integration scenarios into three types: look and feel, data, and process integration. These types have some overlap, but also some distinct characteristics and expected behaviors.

## Choose a pattern

[Choosing the right pattern](integrate-other-solutions-choose-pattern.md) is crucial for successfully connecting systems. When you choose an integration pattern, you should consider factors such as:

- What is its main functionality?
- How is it built?
- What is the platform, language, user interface, and connectivity type?

You should also consider what type of actions you need the integration to perform.

## Challenges in integration

Organizations rely on various applications for their IT operations. These applications might be located on-premises, in the cloud, or provided by partners. They need to exchange data and information for different business purposes. However, [integrating them can be challenging](integrate-other-solutions-challenges.md). A key focus of any IT department is making sure that integrations facilitate business productivity and not hinder it.

## Product-specific guidance

[Learn about the aspects of integrations that are specific to each Dynamics 365 app](integrate-other-solutions-guidance-product.md).

## Conclusion

Dynamics 365 apps can help you build a larger solution landscape for your organization. You can use automation to create smooth and effective processes across systems and avoid mistakes.

You can also use integration to close the digital feedback loop. Integration can give you access to all your data, not just for reporting and visibility, but also for your users. With Azure, Power Platform, and Dataverse, you can begin your integration journey. You can use reporting, analytics, and AI to get the right information to the right people at the right time.

You don't need huge investments to start your journey. You can use Microsoft cloud technology and Power Platform to create solutions with low-code/no-code tools and the citizen developer approach.
