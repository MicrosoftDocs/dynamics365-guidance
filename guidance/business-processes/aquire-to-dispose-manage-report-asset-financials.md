# Support your organization’s business processes to manage and report on asset financials

***This applies to: Dynamics 365 Finance,*** ***Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

This article describes how you can use Dynamics 365 products to support your organization's business processes to *manage and report on asset financials*.

## Introduction to manage and report on asset financials

Organization may have certain assets that are large items in the balance sheet. Based on the location and area where the assets are installed or deployed, there may be extra tax component associated with the asset. These assets may have insurance associated with them as well. In some cases, assets may be leased out to a lessee. Hence, it becomes important for companies to optimally manage and report asset information.

Fixed assets are reported on the balance sheet. Activities related to investments are captured in a company's cash flow statement. The acquisition or disposal of an asset is also recorded in the cash flow statement.

When you use a general ledger together with fixed assets, you can view the current value of all fixed assets. The way in which fixed assets are handled must correspond to both international accounting standards and the accounting legislation in each country/region.

Companies start off by evaluating the need for assets and budget/plan it up in advance. The process then involves either acquiring an asset or leasing an asset depending on multiple parameters. In case the asset is acquired, it goes through a high-level process that could be a mix of more asset related information adjustment, depreciation, disposal. Companies can define rules to record acquisition method, depreciation and disposal, write-ups and write-downs.

The management of assets and its finance is an ongoing operational process for an organization. It becomes more important when audits are executed to review financial information.

In Dynamics 365, you find multiple reports to assess fixed asset information. One such example is the [Fixed assets roll forward report (Finance)](/dynamics365/finance/fixed-assets/fixed-asset-roll-forward-report).

## Manage and report on asset financials benefits

### Effective financial management

Having inaccurate fixed asset information can lead to incorrect financial reporting. During audits, the auditing entity may flag off certain assets that don't have correct financial information. Hence, maintaining accurate financial information is important. It helps in building investor and shareholder confidence in an organization and also helps to maintain credibility with vendors.

### Improved reporting

When organizations manage and conduct regular reviews of their assets, applying proper controls and processes, the overall asset journey can be laid out properly via financial reports by the accounting team. Such reporting helps in identifying any gaps, issues with information of assets, its financial impacts to the general ledger and a company's performance using these assets.
