The *manage supplier relationships* business process area can help you:

- **Reduce costs** by improving efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in your procurement activities. You can shorten processing times, negotiate better prices with suppliers, and lower accounting expenses. You can also get better terms and conditions, service levels, and discounts from suppliers who value your relationship.

- **Improve planning** by gaining insights into your suppliers' operations, such as lead times, production capacity, and potential bottlenecks. You can use this information to plan your inventory management and production scheduling. You can also respond more effectively to unexpected situations, such as a surge in demand or a disruption in the supply chain.

- **Streamline procurement** by having a centralized view of all your purchasing activities. You can monitor them in real-time, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions.

- **Enhance supplier relationships** by communicating effectively with your suppliers. You can keep them updated about your changing needs and situations. They're more likely to keep you informed about theirs. They're also more likely to be responsive to your requests, both expected and unexpected. You can use the **Vendor Collaboration** module in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to share information about purchase orders, invoices, and consignment stock with external suppliers.

- **Reduce risks** by working closely with your suppliers. They're more likely to be transparent about their own risks and proactive in implementing risk mitigation strategies. They're also more likely to meet their contractual obligations, reducing the risk of delays or quality issues.

- **Evaluate supplier performance and compliance** by using a consistent and methodical approach to assess your suppliers. You can use the supplier evaluation functionality in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to manually evaluate suppliers based on various criteria. You can also use Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to develop strategies for increasing sales, reducing inefficiencies, and increasing revenue. Additionally, you can ensure adherence to procurement policies, minimize the likelihood of fraudulent or corrupt activities, and maintain a record for regulatory compliance purposes.
