# What are the Dynamics 365 TechTalk videos?

FastTrack TechTalks focus on providing technical depth and best practices that provide customers and partners with detailed knowledge that's specific to the subject areas. This article describes the purpose of Dynamics 365 TechTalks and how to subscribe to notifications about upcoming TechTalks, find past TechTalks including recordings and other artifacts.

## About TechTalks

Dynamics 365 TechTalks are a platform for FastTrack solution architects and engineering to provide implementation guidance and best ​​​​​​​practices. They also showcase new and existing features throughout Dynamics 365. 

TechTalks are typically a 60-minute presentation presented live in two different time zones. Anyone can register for a TechTalk to receive the link to the live session. Live TechTalks include questions and answer sessions at the end as an opportunity to get your questions answered.

Each TechTalk is recorded and shared on the [Dynamics 365 Community](https://community.dynamics.com/blogs/?blogid=e624b369-bfb9-4c57-8f1b-b3656ac91f5a) site and the [Dynamics 365 Community](https://www.youtube.com/%40MSD365Community/featured) YouTube channel. You can download a PDF of the slides for the presentation from the [Dynamics 365 Community](https://community.dynamics.com/blogs/?blogid=e624b369-bfb9-4c57-8f1b-b3656ac91f5a) site.
