This business process area involves categorizing services based on various attributes, such as the service type and brand. The exact categories in your organization vary, depending on the type of services that you offer, their complexity, and the industry. Categorization helps organize services and makes it easier for customers to find what they are looking for. Internally, categorization helps you report and analyze trends for your services. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management and Commerce support the creation of category hierarchies to further enhance the discoverability of your services.

<!-- ## Introduce new services

Office 365 includes a variety of tools to help you remain organized, and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes tools, such as a configurable workflow, to help with the business process flow of introducing new services. For more basic services, you can also design a business process flow in Dynamics 365 Sales. When you're ready to test new services and advertise new service offerings, Dynamics 365 Marketing includes a variety of tools to help with the process. A well-managed introduction of new services can help organizations remain competitive and meet customer needs.

## Define service costing

All organizations must analyze and define the costs that are associated with developing and delivering services. These costs include direct labor costs and overhead costs. Dynamics 365 Sales includes functionality for assigning basic costs to services. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes more robust costing capabilities. Examples include multiple costing methodologies, such as last in, first out (LIFO), first in, first out (FIFO), standard, and average costing, and indirect cost calculations for overheads. An understanding of service costs is essential for setting prices and making informed business decisions.

## Manage service pricing

After you define costs, you can start to manage and define service prices, based on factors such as cost, competition, and customer demand. Effective pricing strategies can help organizations improve profitability and maintain a competitive advantage. Dynamics 365 Sales includes basic sales pricing functionality. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management has a pricing engine that includes trade agreements, price lists, customer loyalty programs, promotions, and discounts to help determine the best price.
