# Checklist for process-focused solutions

## Focus on your business processes

| Done? | Task |
| :---: | --- |
| &check; | Make sure you put the business process view of your organization at the center of your project definition.
| &check; | Clearly describe the key business processes and the personas involved in them that are in scope for your project so that everyone understands them.
| &check; | Make sure you include business model analysis, process engineering, and standardization strategies in your project definition. This way, you can establish a strong process baseline before you start the implementation.
| &check; | Collect your business processes in a structured and hierarchical process catalog during the requirements phase.

## Use business processes for each project phase

| Done? | Task |
| :---: | --- |
| &check; | Use business processes for each phase of your project to achieve better outcomes&mdash;all phase activities are better planned, executed, and measured.

## Optimize your processes

| Done? | Task |
| :---: | --- |
| &check; | Look for opportunities to improve, streamline, and consolidate your processes as part of the implementation to meet your digital transformation goals and drive user adoption.
| &check; | Make sure you complete your business process definition and include all activities and subprocesses.
| &check; | Use the latest software as a service (SaaS) technology to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of your process optimization.
| &check; | Make sure you prepare for the future when you map your business process to your solution by incorporating configurability by design.

## Do fit-to-standard and fit-gap analysis

| Done? | Task |
| :---: | --- |
| &check; | Use a fit-to-standard approach and follow the principle of adopting the standard processes wherever possible and adapting them only where necessary.
