# Set the ground rules for Dynamics 365 implementation projects

During the Implement phase of an implementation project, several project processes govern all activities. The processes are defined in the methodology and approach.

## Teach the methodology

A common pitfall is when implementation project teams aren't aligned about when or why some activities occur. For example, a stakeholder attends a meeting to discuss a specific process but is unaware that the purpose of such meetings is to gather information for decision making. This situation can lead to a delay in making critical decisions.

Maybe you taught the methodology during the project's kick-off. However, months into a project, stakeholders might not remember what they were taught in the early project stages.

It's often during the Implement phase that most stakeholders experience the methodology-heavy activities for the first time. Therefore, an effort to establish and maintain shared understanding of the methodology is important.

## Measure the adoption of the methodology

It's one thing to teach the methodology. However, it's another thing for knowledge of the methodology to empower stakeholders to follow it. If people don't invest their minds in understanding the processes or toolset, we might lose track of important reasoning behind trade-off decisions or scope changes. This disconnect might make discussions about some subjects resurface repeatedly.

It's important for the change manager to understand that the project team's adoption of processes during the implementation project pre-go-live is as critical as user adoption of the solution post-go-live. Therefore, adoption should be measured through means that are proportional to the size and complexity of the project. Any need for reinforcement of the methodology and toolset should be brought to the project leadership.
