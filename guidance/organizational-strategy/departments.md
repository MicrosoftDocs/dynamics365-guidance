# Departments and business processes

Dynamics 365 provides dedicated functionality for typical business areas across industries and geographies. To deliver products and services in fast-changing markets and technologies, you need efficient and scalable business processes. Business applications can help you improve your processes by automating, optimizing, and standardizing them. This way, you can create a more adaptable and effective solution.

## Departments

In the this section, we use the term *department*, but you can also think of these buckets as *business areas* or *assignments* in any given organization. In very large organizations, some of the departments can contain hundreds or thousands of employees and have several subteams. In very small organizations, an employee might cover two or three roles across the departments in this article.

The following diagram maps the end-to-end business processes to the typical departments in many organizations. In the diagram, a colored box means that this end-to-end business process impacts that department.
