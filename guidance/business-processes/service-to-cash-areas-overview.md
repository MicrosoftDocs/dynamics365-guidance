***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Guides, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

The *service to cash* process is broken down into several business process areas. In this article, you'll learn about the business process areas that make up the service to cash flow in Dynamics 365 solutions.

## Manage service assets

Many organizations provide services for products that their customers buy, lease, or get from other sources. These products need regular maintenance and service, such as installation, repair, troubleshooting, or upgrading.  

To manage service assets effectively, you need to keep a record of all the serviceable items (assets) and track them. You also need to record all the information that can help you during the maintenance process.

<!-- 
## Establish servicing policies and procedures

Servicing policies and procedures in Dynamics 365 help you provide high-quality service to your customers. You can define your organization's service policies, including service level agreements (SLAs), response times, and escalation procedures. These policies help your team understands the expectations for service delivery and can respond appropriately to customer requests.

You can also determine the channels through which customers can submit service requests, such as phone, email, or web portal. You can create a process for handling service requeststhat includes assigning resources, tracking progress, and updating customers on the status of their requests.

- Establish procedures for resource management.

- Set up a billing process.

- Monitor and measure your service performance. -->

### Manage service resources

Service resources refer to the people, equipment, and facilities that you need to deliver a service. You can use Dynamics 365 to manage your service resources and provide high-quality customer experiences.

<!-- ### Create and manage accounts for servicing

The ability to effectively create and manage accounts for servicing in Dynamics 365 is core to making sure that the right information is provided for all aspects of the *service to cash* process. Through relationships between accounts and related *service to cash* data, you also gain insights into your service operations, which can improve your overall efficiency. -->

<!-- ## Create and manage assets

Leasing an asset within Dynamics 365 refers to the process of creating and maintaining a lease agreement for a specific asset, such as a piece of equipment, vehicle, or property. With lease management in Dynamics 365, you can create leases and associated assets, manage lease terms and conditions, and track payments and invoices. 

## Create work orders

Work orders are used to track the progress of a job or task from start to finish. They include information such as the job description, the parts and resources required, and the estimated completion time.

To create a work order in Dynamics 365, you start by selecting the appropriate work order type. There are several different types of work orders, including maintenance, repair, and installation orders. Once you select the type of work order, enter the necessary details, such as the customer's name, description, and the priority level.

Next, users can add the necessary resources to the work order, such as labor, equipment, and materials. Dynamics 365 provides a range of tools to help users manage resources. For example, it provides scheduling tools that users can use to assign resources to specific tasks and track progress in real time.

## Schedule work orders

Dynamics 365 provides tools and features to help you schedule work orders efficiently. This helps you allocate resources effectively, ensure tasks are completed on time, and minimize downtime

To schedule work orders, you typically start by reviewing the work order backlog and identifying high-priority tasks. You can then use the scheduling tools to assign resources to these tasks based on their availability and skill set. You can also use automated scheduling optimization capabilities to help you schedule tasks.

You can also use Dynamics 365 to set up preventative maintenance schedules. This involves creating recurring work orders for tasks such as equipment inspections or regular maintenance tasks.  -->

## Create and process service work

A work order is a document that tracks the progress of a job or task from start to finish. It includes information such as the job description, the parts and resources required, and the estimated completion time.

To create a work order in Dynamics 365, you typically start by selecting the appropriate work order type. There are different types of work orders, for different kinds of services, such as maintenance, repair, or installation. Once you select the type of work order, enter the necessary details, such as the customer's name, description, and the priority level.

Next, you add the necessary resources to the work order, such as labor, equipment, and materials. Dynamics 365 provides a range of tools to help users manage resources, including scheduling tools that allow you to assign resources to specific tasks and track progress in real-time.

The execution of work orders within Dynamics 365 involves the actual completion of the tasks specified in the work order. This process typically involves multiple steps, including job assignment, tracking progress, updating status, and closing out the work order.

Once you schedule a work order and assign it to a technician or a team, the execution process begins. The technician can access the work order details, including any instructions, checklists, or documentation needed to complete the task. They can also access any necessary tools, equipment, or materials required for the job.

<!-- ## Review and close work orders

Once the work order is completed, the technician can close out the job. This involves updating the work order status to reflect the completion of the task, adding any notes or comments about the job, and closing out any associated purchase orders or invoices.

## Analyze service operations

Dynamics 365 also provides reporting and analytics tools that can be used to analyze work order execution data, such as task completion times, resource use, and cost analysis. This data can be used to optimize future work orders and improve the efficiency of the maintenance or repair process. -->

## Invoice customers

The invoice customers process area covers creating and sending an invoice to a customer based on a sales order or a free text invoice. Invoicing is an essential part of the order to cash process. It involves creating and sending a bill to customers for the products or services they ordered and posting it to the general ledger. The invoicing process starts when a sale takes place and continues through delivery to the customer and receiving payment.

## Record customer payments

Organizations that sell products or services must collect payment for them. Even non-profit organizations want to collect payments in the form of contributions from donors. You can use various methods to record customer payments in Dynamics 365. These methods include online payments, in-person payments at the point of sale, or manual payments that your accounts receivable staff enters in back-office applications.  

## Monitor customer credit and collections

In many organizations, not least organizations with a business-to-business sales model, setting credit limits is an important process that helps organizations remain competitive. Credit limits can also help an organization minimize bad debt and the need to write off unpaid balances. When you manage the collection process carefully, it helps you get customers pay on time, increases the cash flow, and helps make the cash flow of the organization more predictable.
