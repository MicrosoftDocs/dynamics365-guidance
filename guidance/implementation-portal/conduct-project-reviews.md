# Conduct project reviews for your Dynamics 365 implementation projects

After your project is set up, you can conduct project reviews. The final project review is the FastTrack team's go-live readiness review.  

All finance and operations apps implementation projects must complete a [go-live readiness review with Microsoft](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/imp-lifecycle/prepare-go-live#readiness) before the production environment can be deployed. After it reviews the project based on information in the Implementation Portal, the FastTrack team provides a report that describes potential risks, best practices, and recommendations for a successful go-live. The review might require up to three business days for the initial report, plus time for any risk mitigation that's required.

## Review status

Reviews can have the following statuses:  

* **Planned**: A review is ready for the project team to start providing answers to the FastTrack team's questions.

* **Discover**: The project team is providing answers to the questions.  

* **In-review**: The FastTrack team is reviewing the project team's answers to the questions, analyzing the findings, and determining recommendations.

* **Mitigation**: The FastTrack team has shared the outcome of the review with the project team and is waiting for confirmation that the project team has addressed critical risks and issues.

* **Complete**: The go-live readiness review is complete. Microsoft switches on the production environment slot in Dynamics 365 Lifecycle Services, and the project team can deploy the production environment.

## Messages

During the go-live readiness review, the FastTrack team may contact admins of projects that aren't managed by FastTrack. The FastTrack team submits a message for each issue or risk, and admins can provide answers, on the **Messages** tab.

The **Messages** tab is located in two places:

* On the project's **Summary** tab, the **Messages** tab lists all messages related to the project.

* A review record's **Messages** tab lists messages that are related to the review or to risks and issues that have been identified as part of the review.

> [!NOTE]
> Messages become available in the portal only after the FastTrack team sends an initial message. Not all projects will have this feature enabled in the early phases of the implementation journey.
