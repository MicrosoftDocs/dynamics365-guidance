# TechTalk: Solution blueprint review with FastTrack for Dynamics 365

The FastTrack for Dynamics 365 program offers organizations a structured approach to successful project implementations through the *solution blueprint review*. This crucial process is part of Microsoft's broader *Success by Design* methodology. It ensures that the project's scope, solution concepts, and initial designs are aligned from the outset. This article explains the importance, value, and execution of the solution blueprint review. The article and the TechTalk that it summarizes emphasize how the solution blueprint review helps with risk detection, project clarity, and overall alignment between partners and customers.

We based this article on [a TechTalk](https://youtu.be/LXgG_dw4NcE) that you can find online in the Dynamics 365 channel on YouTube.

## The purpose of a solution blueprint review

The solution blueprint review is designed to validate the overarching scope and design concepts of a Dynamics 365 implementation. At its core, the review serves as a workshop where the organization and its partner make sure that all parties understand the solution's foundational concepts. The purpose isn't to dive into the finer technical details. Instead, the review should focus on high-level concepts to ensure that the design is sound, and that risks are identified early.

To prepare for the solution blueprint review, gather the details of the implementation project. These details include the following information:

- Strategy documents:

    - Application lifecycle management (ALM) strategy
    - Structure for business units and legal entities
    - Environment strategy
    - Data strategy (data entities and migration scope)
    - Integration strategy (interfaces)
    - Production instance strategy
    - Security strategy
    - Test plan or strategy
    - Deployment locations
    - Analytical data aggregation (scope)

- Project management artifacts:

    - Project charter
    - Process catalog
    - Application diagram
    - Project plan and schedule
    - Process block diagram
    - Responsibility matrix
    - Key gaps
    - System usage profiles

By having the solution blueprint review at the very beginning of the implementation process, you establish communication between the implementation team and the customer organization. In this way, you set the stage for deeper discussions about what is being built and how that goal can be achieved. The aim is to uncover misalignments or forgotten components early enough so that any issues that might arise later can be mitigated.

The review ensures that all stakeholders are "on the same page" about the project's scope, from high-level functional needs to broad technical approaches. In this way, it creates a baseline for the rest of the project's implementation. Teams can then plan deeper dives and workshops about specific areas as they require.

## Detect risks early in the project lifecycle

One of the most significant advantages of the solution blueprint review is its ability to highlight risks and issues early. Like the *Success by Design* methodology that it's part of, the solution blueprint review puts an emphasis on risk prevention. By addressing possible challenges in the initial stages of the project, the implementation team can avoid costly disruptions later.

The review helps identify risks that are related to the scope, timelines, and other critical aspects of the project. For example, it might reveal that the project's solution concepts are misaligned with the customer's goals, or that there are gaps in the plan. These issues can then be addressed before they become larger problems. Microsoft FastTrack resources work closely with the implementation team to address these risks and ensure the stability of the project as it moves forward.

## The process of a solution blueprint review

In the first step of the process, the implementation team provides key inputs and materials about the project. The FastTrack team then reviews those inputs to gain an understanding of the scope and design of the solution.

After the input materials are reviewed, a workshop is conducted to gather more insights and observations. During this step, the review team collects detailed findings and categorizes them into risks, issues, or key assertions. Recommendations are then provided to address any identified risks.

For simpler projects, the workshop might last just a few hours. For more complex implementations, such as solutions that involve multiple applications (for example, Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management), the workshop can last up to eight hours. The aim is to strike a balance in terms of the level of detail. On one hand, workshop participants should do a broad review of solution concepts. On the other hand, they should dig into enough detail so that they can identify potential issues. However, they should not try to address every specific issue during the workshop.

After the workshop, the findings are processed and reviewed with the implementation team. Final findings are then documented and shared with all key stakeholders to ensure transparency and clarity as the project moves forward.

## Address common objections

Sometimes, implementation teams or customers push back on the idea of doing a solution blueprint review up front. They might argue that the project isn't ready, or that the blueprint should wait until after the analysis and design phases. However, these objections often indicate a lack of clarity in the project's foundation. If a project doesn't have a solid blueprint at the outset, it's already at risk.

If definition of the blueprint is postponed until later stages, identification of critical risks is also postponed. Therefore, we don't recommend this approach. A project that has an undefined or "loose" scope should be closely examined. The aim should be to ensure that everyone understands the variables and agrees about how to stabilize the project's foundation before the project moves forward.

## Plan and conduct the review

When you conduct the solution blueprint review, preparation is key. Gather as many relevant details as you can, including the project scope, key goals, and artifacts. In this way, you ensure a comprehensive review. Although some materials might not be fully developed in the early stages, it's essential that you have a basic scope and a general implementation approach.

The solution blueprint review workshop can last an hour or a day. The time that is required depends on many factors, such as the Dynamics 365 apps and capabilities that are included in the project, and the external systems that the solution must connect to.

Other factors include the following questions:

- How much is known up front?
- How early in the project is the workshop?
- How complex is the implementation?
- How standard is the approach?

After the review workshop is scheduled, effective time management is important, especially for larger, more complex solutions. In most cases, the workshop is conducted remotely. Additionally, it's usually split into multiple sessions over a week or two, to accommodate the team's availability and maintain focus on specific aspects of the solution.

Participants in the review workshop should include the core members of the implementation team, such as project managers and solution architects from both the customer and partner sides. Attendance by the right participants ensures effective communication and understanding of the project's complexity and structure.

In the case of FastTrack engagements for customers that invest $100,000–300,000, the FastTrack team doesn't attend the review workshop. Instead, FastTrack spends approximately 45 minutes reviewing the outcomes of the workshop.

## Post-review process and follow-up

After the solution blueprint review workshop is completed, findings are categorized and structured for easy understanding. Regardless of whether the findings are categorized as risks, issues, or assertions, they are shared with the project team, together with actionable recommendations.

For projects that are within the $100,000–300,000 range, the partner architect typically drives the solution blueprint review. Microsoft FastTrack architects then spend some time reviewing the outcomes and suggesting improvements. For larger projects, FastTrack architects take a more hands-on role in the production of findings and recommendations.

After findings are finalized, they are shared not only with the implementation team but also with key project stakeholders. This approach ensures that everyone who is involved in the project understands its health, risks, and next steps.

## Conclusion

The solution blueprint review is an essential component of the FastTrack for Dynamics 365 program. By ensuring that all parties have a clear understanding of the project's scope and design from the outset, this process mitigates risks and sets the foundation for a successful implementation. When potential issues are addressed early in the project lifecycle, there is less risk of disruptions, and the project remains on track.
