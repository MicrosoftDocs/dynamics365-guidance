# Customer eligibility and partner qualifications

Eligible customers can take advantage of FastTrack services that are based on [Success by Design](../implementation-guide/success-by-design.md) and include solution blueprint reviews and go-live readiness reviews. FastTrack can also pull in implementation support from Microsoft engineering teams.  

## Eligibility requirements

Eligible customers benefit from FastTrack for the following Dynamics 365 business applications:  

- Dynamics 365 apps as delivered by Microsoft
- Built-in agents in Dynamics 365 apps
- Copilot in Dynamics 365 

Associated Power Platform workloads (Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Pages) are considered if Dynamics 365 is the primary focus of the engagement. All other eligibility criteria must be met.

To be eligible, customers must:  

1. Meet a minimum annual spend across their Dynamics 365 licenses in new deployments of eligible Dynamics 365 applications.
2. Be attached to an implementation partner that is qualified:

   - A [Solutions Partner for Business Applications](https://aka.ms/d365ftsolutionspartnerbusiness) with at least two [eligible customer deployments](https://aka.ms/d365fteligibledeployments).

     Customer engagement deployments are required for projects with customer engagement apps; Finance and operations deployments are required for projects with finance and operations apps. <!--pending update from FT team-->
   - Success by Design training and knowledge check completed before the project starts.

Customers who don't meet these eligibility requirements are invited to take advantage of available self-guided FastTrack resources, which include [on-demand Success by Design training](/training/modules/success-by-design/), [product TechTalks](https://community.dynamics.com/blogs/?blogid=e624b369-bfb9-4c57-8f1b-b3656ac91f5a), and a [go-live readiness assessment](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/imp-lifecycle/prepare-go-live) for select Dynamics 365 applications.

For more details, reach out to your partner or Microsoft account team.
