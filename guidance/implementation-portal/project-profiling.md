# What is a good profile in the Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal?

In this article, we describe the characteristics of a good profile and how to profile your project well.

## Profile details

A good profile in the Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal is important because it helps both you and Microsoft ensure that the proper context is available for guidance and proactive support. Project details, such as the complete list of products being implemented and the features for each of them, play a vital role in profile details. Implementation guidance is tailored to your project based on information in the profile. You can update the project profile on the ​*Project Profile* tab.

## Keep the profile current

A good profile should also specify the products, features, and growth characteristics of the implementation project. We suggest adding the profiling when the project is created and keeping the profile updated as the project scope and detail changes through the implementation. Keeping the profile updated at regular intervals to match the reality of the project is recommended. 

Here are some examples of what to include in a good profile:

- ​**Products**: All the products in scope for the implementation project.
- **Features**: Features that are being implemented for the products in the project.
- **Size**: The number of users who are using the system, the number of locations where the system is deployed, and the amount of data that is processed.
- **Complexity**: The number of customizations required, the level of integration with other systems, and the level of data migration required.
- **Growth**: The expected growth rate of the system, the expected number of users, and the expected number of locations.
- **Other characteristics**: As detailed as feasible. Any information allows the portal to tailor specific proactive information relevant to the project.

On the other hand, a bad profile is one that is incomplete or lacks detail. For example, a profile that only specifies the products wouldn't be helpful in tailoring implementation guidance to the project.

If you're a partner in the Partner Portfolio Model, good project profiling across projects lifts the portfolio score.

## How to profile

Here are the step-by-step instructions for profiling a project in the Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal:

1. Sign in to the Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal using your work account or personal Microsoft account.

2. In the left side panel, select **Projects**.

3. Select the project you want to manage.

4. The **Project Profile** tab gives you an overview of all the details of the project. You can switch between read-only and editable views of the Project Profile tab.

5. Use the project profile to specify the products and features in the implementation project. Implementation guidance is tailored to your project based on information in the profile. 

6. When you select a product, the page shows the product's features. 

7. Select **Done** to save your changes. A notification at the top of the page tells you that implementation guidance is based on the changes you made. When the message **Guidance is generated successfully** appears, select the Implementation guidance tab to view refreshed recommendations.
