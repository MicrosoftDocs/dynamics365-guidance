This article describes the business process area of travel and expense management (T&E). This process tracks the money that employees spend when they incur expenses for your business. Managing travel and expenses is crucial for any organization. It involves documenting and processing all business-related costs that employees incur so that you can report taxes, ensure budget compliance, track business intelligence, and manage the employee experience.

As a part of this process, organizations often define expense policies and automate the reimbursement of travel expenses. They define if employees charge expenses to a corporate credit card, spend cash from a cash advance, or incur out-of-pocket expenses that the organization then reimburses. The process of travel and expense (T&E) management can be complex and involves accurately gathering and recording all travel-related expenses. When you apply the right technology, it can augment expense management by storing payment method information and importing credit card transactions. This way, it helps facilitating the use of travel requisitions to review and authorize expenses before they incur.

Organizations should consider implementing technology to augment their policies for managing travel and expense when they face challenges in the T&E management process. Common challenges include the following list:

- Time-consuming review and approval of expense reports  
- Errors in manual data entry  
- Lack of visibility into travel and expense data  

Implementing technology can help organizations overcome these challenges and streamline the T&E management process. For example, expense management software with image-scanning technology can help finance teams scan receipts, extract crucial data, and autofill digital expense reports. Such software can help the organization reduce the risk of errors and make the process faster.

## Stakeholders 

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of the *Manage travel and expenses* area. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

- **Management**: Roles such as finance managers, CEOs, COOs, and various line managers are integral in creating and adjusting policies for meetings, travels, and expenses that align with business needs. Their input is essential to optimize operational efficiency and manage relationships with employees, customers, vendors, and even preferred travel vendors. Frontline supervisors can be crucial in the review and approval process of travel and expenses.

- **Employees**: Employees are stakeholders in the travel and expense process, as they incur expenses for your business and are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of their records. Clear communication and enforcement of policies are vital to their effective engagement in these processes.

- **Human resources**: HR managers and HR specialists and similar roles are crucial to involve in defining and managing travel and expense policies, ensuring alignment with HR guidelines and regulations. They play a key role in shaping policies that reflect the organization's culture and compliance requirements.

- **Project managers**: In the context of Dynamics 365 Project Operations and service-based organizations, project managers play key roles by overseeing the integration of expense data with project records, and they manage any team activities that result from travel. They ensure that project schedules align with the availability of resources. They can be crucial in the review and approval process of travel and expenses.

- **Compliance officers**: Compliance officers are responsible for ensuring that the organization adheres to relevant regulations and standards. They use the system to monitor and report on compliance, track regulatory changes, and make necessary adjustments to policies and procedures to maintain legal and ethical compliance.
