# Raise purchase requisitions overview

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

This article describes the importance of *purchase requisitions* as a crucial internal document in supporting your organization's purchasing needs, and explains how Dynamics 365 products can streamline their creation.

Many organizations use purchase requisitions as a formal request made by an employee or department to acquire goods or services. It serves as the initial step in the procurement process, outlining the need for certain items or services. The benefits of using purchase requisitions are:

- **Control and oversight**: Purchase requisitions help in controlling and monitoring the procurement process by ensuring that all purchases are authorized and align with the organization's budget and objectives.
- **Budget management**: They assist in managing budgets more effectively by providing visibility into planned purchases before they're made.
- **Streamlining procurement**: Purchase requisitions streamline the procurement process by centralizing requests and standardizing documentation, leading to greater efficiency and consistency in the procurement creation process.
- **Compliance and audit**: They contribute to ensuring compliance with internal policies and external regulations by documenting the approval process and providing a paper trail for audits.

Purchase requisitions aren't mandatory for every organization, but they can be useful when you need more control and visibility over the purchasing process. If you want to include purchase requisitions in your scope, plan to address them before purchase orders, as they affect the downstream processes of creating and approving orders. You can also add purchase requisitions later in your project, but this may require some adjustments in your existing purchasing workflows and policies.

A poorly-defined business process for purchase requisitions can lead to inefficiencies, errors, and delays in the purchasing cycle, as well as increased risk of fraud and non-compliance. While a well-defined process can streamline the approval workflow, improve the accuracy and transparency of the purchasing data, and enhance the collaboration and communication between the purchasing and requesting departments.
## Stakeholders

Many people across the organization should contribute to the *raise purchase requisitions* business process. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

- **Procurement stakeholders**: Roles such as Buyer, Director of Procurement, Purchasing agent, Purchasing manager and various line managers are integral part of providing insight on purchase process within the organization. Frontline supervisors are critical in the review and approval of purchase requisition.
- **Management**: Roles such as finance managers, CEOs, COOs, and various line managers are for approvals of large purchase requisitions and make decisions on spending and approval authority of organizational personnel.
- **Project managers**: In the context of Dynamics 365 Project Operations and service-based organizations, project managers play key roles by overseeing the purchase requisition process related to their specific project. They can be crucial in the review and approval of purchase requisitions.
- **Compliance officers and internal auditors**: Compliance officers are responsible for ensuring that the organization adheres to relevant regulations and standards. They use the system to monitor and report on compliance, track regulatory changes, and make necessary adjustments to policies and procedures to maintain legal and ethical compliance.
- **Employees**: Employees request for item or services for your business and are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of their records.

## Process flow

The following diagram illustrates the *Raise purchase requisitions* business process area.

Before you begin, ensure to create an employee. The steps in the process flow diagram are grouped into swim lanes to indicate which role is responsible for each step.

If you're an employee, follow these steps:

1. Start
2. Manually, identify need of product or service.
3. Manually, collect information regarding the requirement or services such as product ID or description of service and price.
4. Create or update purchase requisition.
5. Add new line and select legal entity.
6. Select procurement category if the item isn't known.
7. Enter quantity required.
8. Select receiving operating unit.
9. Known price
    1.  If yes, then enter unit price if the purchase requisition line is for a category. If the purchase requisition line is for an item and a trade agreement exists, then the price is defaulted for the trade agreement.
    2.  If no, proceed to step 10.
10. Submit requisition.

If you're a purchasing agent, follow these steps:

11. Navigate to *purchase requisition assigned to me* form.
12. Request for quotation required.
    1.  If yes, then initiate request for quotation (RFQ) process.
    2.  If no, then review or enter unit price and unit of measure.
13.  Select final vendor and attach document (if applicable).
14.  Submit requisition.

If you're a manager or accounting manager, follow these steps:

1.  Approval required.
    1.  If yes, then accounting manager accesses the *purchase requisition assigned to me* form.
    2.  If no, then proceed to step 18.
2.  Approved
    1.  If yes, then proceed to step 17.
    2.  If no, then go to step 5 in the **Employee** swin lane.
3.  Purchase order process initiated.
4.  End

## Purchase policy overview

A purchasing policy is a set of rules that govern the requisition process, helping procurement administrators align with the organization's strategic purchasing goals. To create a purchasing policy, you must define and configure policy rules along with start date and end date.

A policy must be linked to an organization before it can take effect. Purchasing policies are tied to the procurement internal control hierarchy purpose, thus they only apply to organizations within hierarchies with this designation. Additionally, you can choose organizations from legal entities list known as Companies in the policy framework.

Purchase requisition lines let users choose items from an assigned catalog. If an item or service isn't in the catalog, users can still select the category and manually enter the product name and details.

The purchase policy can be adjusted to match the organization's purchasing process. These rules govern procurement and requisition processes, including catalog and category access, vendor selection, and re-approval for purchase orders. They also define criteria for informal or formal RFQs and offer optional controls for requisition purposes and replenishment. Additionally, they outline policies for consolidating and generating purchase orders from approved requisitions.

## Implement raise purchase requisitions

Purchase requisition is a global feature that allows users to create a request across all legal entities in the organization. This means that a user can specify that they want a product or service for Company A or Company B, for example. In contrast, purchase orders are always specific to the current company.

In Dynamics 365, you have the option to create a purchase requisition before creating a purchase order to take advantage of the benefits mentioned above. Alternatively, Dynamics 365 also allows you to directly create a purchase order without first creating a purchase requisition.

## Requisition purposes

Requisition purposes make the process of fulfilling requisition demands more flexible. When you create a requisition, you can assign one of two purposes to it:

- Consumption
- Replenishment

In the procurement policies, you can control the requisition purposes that're available when a requisition is created for your organization.

- **Purpose of consumption**: A requisition that has a purpose of consumption represents demand for items or services that are used internally by your organization. The demand is created by a purchase order. If purchasing policy is set up with automatically creation of purchase order, then order is created and is in approved state.
- **Purpose of replenishment**: A requisition that has the purpose of replenishment represents demand to replenish inventory. For example, you create a requisition to replenish items so that they can be sold at a specific location at a specific time. The demand for such requisition can result in purchase order, transfer order, or production order.
