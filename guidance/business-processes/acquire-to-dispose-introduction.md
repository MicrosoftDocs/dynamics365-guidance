# Introduction to Dynamics 365 acquire to dispose business process areas

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Dynamics 365 Guides, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist***

This article introduces the *acquire to dispose* end-to-end business process. It outlines how Dynamics 365 products can help organizations manage and optimize their *acquire to dispose* processes.

## Acquire to dispose overview

The *acquire to dispose* process is a critical business process that involves managing the lifecycle of both owned and leased assets from acquisition to disposal. This process includes the acquisition, deployment, maintenance, and eventual disposal of assets such as equipment, vehicles, and property. Dynamics 365 can be used to support this process by providing a centralized platform for managing asset data, tracking asset usage and maintenance history, and streamlining the asset disposal process.

We have defined the *acquire to dispose* process here to also include financial management or accounting processes of fixed assets and asset leases. This includes the planning, budgeting, and management process for owned and leased assets. By implementing Dynamics 365 to support the *acquire to dispose* process, organizations can improve asset visibility, increase operational efficiency, and reduce costs associated with asset management.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The process defined here does not include the process for selling assets to customers and is covered as part of the Order to cash process. Learn more at [Order to cash - introduction to the end-to-end business process](order-to-cash-introduction.md). Additionally, leasing an asset to your customer or servicing assets for your customers is not included. These processes are covered in the Service to cash end-to-end process. Learn more at [Service to cash - introduction to the end-to-end business process](service-to-cash-introduction.md).  

Every organization has variations to the *acquire to dispose* process. Here, we define the basic outline for any organization looking to implement a technology solution to support the *acquire to dispose* process.

## Effect

Implementing technology solutions to support the *acquire to dispose* process can have a significant impact on a business. By using a centralized platform like Dynamics 365, businesses can improve the visibility and control they have over their assets, resulting in improved decision-making and resource utilization. With better tracking and management of assets, organizations can minimize downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and extend the useful life of their assets, which can ultimately lead to cost savings and increased profitability. In addition, using technology solutions to support the *acquire to dispose* process can also help ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and reduce the risk of errors or omissions in asset management.

## Stakeholders

The stakeholders involved in implementing technology solutions to support the *acquire to dispose* process can vary depending on the organization. However, some common stakeholders include:

- Asset managers - responsible for managing the lifecycle of assets from acquisition to disposal

- IT department - responsible for implementing and maintaining technology solutions to support the *acquire to dispose* process

- Finance department - responsible for tracking asset costs and depreciation

- Operations department - responsible for utilizing assets to support business operations

- Human resources department – responsible for hiring and training users who will be operating the assets

- Procurement department - responsible for purchasing assets and managing vendor relationships

- Legal and compliance department - responsible for ensuring regulatory compliance related to asset management and disposal

- Executive leadership - responsible for overseeing the acquisition and disposal of high-value assets and ensuring alignment with strategic goals.

It is important for all stakeholders to work together to define business requirements, identify technology solutions that meet those requirements, and ensure successful implementation and adoption of those solutions.

## Acquire to dispose benefits

When your organization plans to implement technology solutions to assist with the *acquire to dispose* process, there are several benefits the solution can help provide. These key benefits should be used to determine if the solution is a good fit for your business and to drive the specific business requirements for implementing the solution. As a side effect, these benefits can be used to create a baseline for your goals and objectives for the project so that you can measure the success of implementing solutions to meet those business requirements. Dynamics 365 is a flexible platform that can support the entire acquisition to disposal process, including financial aspects for fixed assets and asset leasing, as well as enterprise asset management. Some of the benefits of using Dynamics 365 for this purpose include:

### Improved asset tracking

Dynamics 365 allows organizations to track their assets throughout the entire lifecycle, from acquisition to disposal. This helps organizations to ensure that their assets are properly managed and maintained, reducing the risk of lost or stolen assets and improving overall asset utilization.

### Accurate asset valuation

Dynamics 365 provides accurate and up-to-date information on the value of fixed assets, allowing organizations to make informed decisions about asset depreciation, write-downs, and disposal. This can help organizations to improve their financial reporting and compliance with accounting standards.

### Improved asset leasing management (lessee)

Dynamics 365 can help organizations to manage the leased assets as a lessee more effectively, with features such as lease accounting, lease management, and lease portfolio analysis. This can help organizations to reduce the risk of lease errors, improve lease compliance, and achieve cost savings.

### Streamlined maintenance management

Dynamics 365 provides tools for managing the maintenance of assets, including preventive maintenance scheduling, work order management, and asset performance analytics. This can help organizations to reduce maintenance costs, extend the life of their assets, and improve overall asset reliability.

### Improved financial reporting

Dynamics 365 provides a centralized system for managing all financial aspects of the acquisition to disposal process, including fixed asset accounting, depreciation, and financial reporting. This can help organizations to improve their financial reporting accuracy, reduce the risk of errors, and comply with accounting standards.
