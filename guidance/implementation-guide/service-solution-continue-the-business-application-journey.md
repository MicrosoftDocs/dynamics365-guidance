# Continue your education on the business application platform

The importance of continuing your education on the business application platform is often overlooked. In the on-premises software world, you would go live with a version of your solution and it would mostly remain the same until you decided to develop or purchase add-on functionality. As mentioned earlier in the ser vice update section, the benefit of continuous updates in Dynamics 365 is that you always have access to the newest features to help your business. This also means you have a constant stream of new and better ways to meet your business and technical objectives through your solution.

For example, let's look at integrating Dynamics 365 with external systems. It wasn't very long ago that you needed custom code modules in order to efficiently pass data to and from Dynamics 365. But with tools like Power Automate and Azure Logic Apps, you can build very powerful integrations through configuration with little to no code.

Reporting is another good example. The out-of-the-box experience for reporting had limitations in Dynamics 365—you could only build reports with data stored in Dynamics 365. Now, with tools like Power BI and its capabilities to build reports from data in and outside of Dynamics 365, you have much mor e flexibility to quickly build out and embed powerful reports. Also, some advanced Azure and Microsoft 365 services coexist with Dynamics 365, and are going through the same type of evolution. Everything from business functionality to ALM build and deploy tools are constantly seeing incremental improvements.

The only way to truly understand these benefits and how to best apply them in your solution for the most return on your IT investment is by continuing your education. Gain an understanding of where the business application domain is headed. Strive to understand what is in the Dynamics 365 roadmap, why it's included, and how it can make your solution and your organization more efficient and robust.
