***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Microsoft Supply Chain Center***

This article introduces the *procure to pay* end-to-end business process. It outlines how Dynamics 365 products can help organizations manage and optimize the *procure to pay* processes.

## Procure to pay overview

The *procure to pay* process (also known as *purchase to pay*) is a term used to describe the entire process of purchasing goods or services from a supplier and paying for them. The process includes all the steps from the initial procurement request to the final payment to the supplier.

The *procure to pay* process typically includes the following steps:

1. Identify the need for goods or services  

    This process covers both *indirect procurement*, where the goods or services are not related to the good or service being sold, and *direct procurement*, where demand for the goods or services exists within the production or sales processes. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management supports flexible procurement processes based on business needs. These processes include *request for quotations* (RFQs), *purchase requisitions*, *contracts* (purchase agreements or blanket orders), and *purchase orders* which can be planned or unplanned. Planned purchase orders can be generated automatically from supply or demand forecasts present. Learn more at [Forecast to plan introduction](forecast-to-plan-introduction.md).  

2. Supplier selection  

    The procurement team evaluates potential suppliers and selects the one that meets the requirements. Dynamics 365 also includes functionality to help automate the supplier selection and portal capabilities to allow suppliers to apply online or even respond to requests for quotations.

3. Purchase order creation  

    A purchase order is created and sent to the supplier. It specifies the goods or services required, the price, delivery date, and other terms and conditions. With Dynamics 365, the process may include a purchase requisition, purchase agreement (also known as a contract or blanket order), or a request for quotation.

4. Invoice receipt and verification  

    The supplier sends an invoice for the goods or services, and the invoice is checked for accuracy and completeness. Dynamics 365 includes full AP automation capabilities with OCR through Azure Form Recognizer to assist with this process.

5. Invoice approval  

    The invoice is approved for payment, and the accounts payable team processes the payment.

6. Payment  

    The supplier is paid for the goods or services, usually by electronic funds transfer.

7. Record keeping  

    All relevant documents, including the purchase order, invoice, and payment details, are recorded and stored for future reference.

8. Reporting

    Financial and operational report analysis help keep track of performance of the *procure to pay* process. You can include supply risk analysis, purchase order backorders, vendor performance, and spend analysis.  

The *procure to pay* process is a crucial aspect of business operations, and efficient execution can result in cost savings, increased transparency, and better supplier relationships.

Every organization has variations to procure to pay. Here, we define the basic outline for any organization looking to implement a technology solution to support the procure to pay process.

## Impact

The purpose of the *procure to pay* end-to-end process is to manage the acquisition of goods and services from suppliers in a structured, efficient, and transparent way. It's an important end-to-end process that can help organizations obtain the goods and services they need at the best possible price, with the right quality, in a timely manner, and in compliance with regulatory and internal policies.

A poorly designed or executed *procure to pay* process can negatively impact an organization in several ways, such as:

- Poor management of procurement processes can result in higher costs due to inefficient processes, errors, duplicate payments, late payments, or disputes with suppliers.

- Inefficient procurement processes can lead to delays, bottlenecks, manual workarounds that waste time and resources, reduce productivity, and increase the risk of errors.

- Inconsistent or delayed payments, disputes, or lack of communication with suppliers can damage relationships, reduce trust, and limit the availability of future supply.

- A poorly defined end-to-end process can increase the risk of non-compliance with regulatory requirements, such as tax or environmental regulations, or internal policies, such as procurement policies or code of conduct.

- Inadequate tracking and reporting of procurement activities can limit the visibility into procurement spend, supplier performance, and overall procurement effectiveness.

- Poor procurement practices can damage an organization's reputation and credibility, particularly if there are allegations of corruption or unethical behavior.

In conclusion, the *procure to pay* process is critical to an organization's success. It's essential to have an efficient and effective *procure to pay* process in place to mitigate these risks and optimize the benefits of procurement activities.

## Stakeholders

Implementing a technology solution such as Dynamics 365 to support the *procure to pay* end-to-end processes involves a range of stakeholders from various departments and levels of the organization. Here are some of the typical stakeholders involved:

- **Procurement stakeholders** - examples: Buyer, Director of Procurement, Purchasing agent, Purchasing manager

- **Accounts payable stakeholders** - examples: Accounts payable clerk, Accounts payable manager

- **IT department stakeholders** - examples: System administrator, Business Analyst, Director of IT, Business Systems Analyst

- **Finance stakeholders** – examples: Controller, CFO, Accountant, or Accounting manager

- **Audit or compliance stakeholders** - Internal auditors, External auditors

- **Vendors** - Vendors are the external stakeholders who supply goods and services to the organization and will interact with the system to receive new purchase orders and submit invoices to receive payments.

Successful implementation of Dynamics 365 to support *procure to pay* processes requires collaboration and coordination between these stakeholders. It's essential to involve all stakeholders early in the project planning phase and communicate regularly throughout the implementation process.

## Procure to pay benefits

When your organization plans to implement technology solutions to assist with the *procure to pay* process, there are several benefits the solution can help provide. These key benefits should be used to determine if the solution is a good fit for your business and to drive the specific business requirements for implementing the solution. As a side effect, these benefits can be used to create a baseline for your goals and objectives for the project so that you can measure the success of implementing solutions to meet those business requirements.
