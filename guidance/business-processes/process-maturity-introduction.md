# Process maturity overview

***Applies to: Dynamics 365, Power Platform***

Process maturity is the degree of sophistication, consistency, and efficiency of an organization's processes. It affects how well an organization can manage its processes to achieve strategic goals and deliver quality products or services, and includes concepts such as change management, continuous improvement, and process improvement. A mature process is predictable, controlled, and continuously improved, allowing the organization to optimize its operations and enhance its competitive edge. Microsoft business applications help organizations digitally transform their business processes. To get the most out of these solutions, organizations need to ensure that they have effective process governance, change management, and process management in place.

This article explains what process maturity is and how you can measure it using various models. It also describes how you can create a process management team to improve your process maturity level in implementation projects with Dynamics 365.

## How to measure process maturity

You can use different standard models to assess your process maturity level accurately. These models provide structured frameworks and criteria for evaluating how well your organizational processes perform. Some common models are:

- **Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)**: CMMI measures your organization's capability to manage and improve its processes across five maturity levels, from initial to optimized.

- **ISO 9001**: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 standard focuses on quality management systems and provides guidelines for implementing quality processes, monitoring performance, and achieving customer satisfaction.

- **Six Sigma**: Six Sigma emphasizes process improvement by reducing defects and variations, enhancing efficiency and customer satisfaction.

- **ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)**: ITIL offers best practices for IT service management, helping organizations align IT services with business needs, improve service quality, and optimize resource use.

We recommend that you evaluate your process maturity at the start of your project and repeat the evaluation at key milestones or regular intervals to track your progress. Gartner and Forrester also have self-assessments that you can use to measure your process maturity.

## Benefits of a process management team

A process management team is a dedicated group of people within an organization who are responsible for optimizing processes, eliminating redundancies, and automating routine tasks. A process management team can provide many benefits, such as:

- **Enhanced efficiency**: By streamlining processes and reducing waste, the team can improve operational efficiency and productivity.

- **Improved quality**: By standardizing processes and implementing quality control measures, the team can ensure higher-quality products or services.

- **Better risk management**: By identifying and mitigating risks associated with process failures, compliance issues, or inadequate controls, the team can enhance organizational resilience and stability.

- **Innovation and continuous improvement**: By fostering a culture of innovation and continuous improvement, the team can encourage experimentation, learning, and adaptation to changing market dynamics.

- **Increased adoption**: By simplifying processes and improving communication, the team can facilitate the adoption of new technology solutions like Dynamics 365.

In implementation projects with Dynamics 365 or Power Platform, we recommend that you consider the benefits of creating a process management team. If you have a small organization where a fully dedicated team isn't feasible, you can also create champions or virtual teams to drive process improvement in key areas of your business that align with your project goals.

## Create a process management team

When you create a process management team within your organization, follow these tips:

- **Clearly define objectives and scope**: Articulate the team's mission, goals, and scope of responsibilities clearly to ensure alignment with organizational objectives and priorities.

- **Select competent team members**: Recruit individuals with diverse skills, expertise, and perspectives to complement each other and contribute effectively to process improvement initiatives.

- **Provide adequate training and resources**: Invest in training programs, tools, and resources to equip team members with the necessary knowledge, skills, and support to succeed in their roles.

- **Promote collaboration and communication**: Foster a collaborative and inclusive team culture where members feel comfortable sharing ideas, providing feedback, and working together towards common goals.

## How business processes affect Dynamics 365 projects

Business processes play a pivotal role in maximizing the benefits of technology solutions like Dynamics 365. They have key impacts such as:

- **Alignment with organizational goals**: Well-defined and optimized business processes ensure that Dynamics 365 functionalities are aligned with organizational objectives, so that business operations and strategic initiatives are executed efficiently. The Success by Design framework suggests that you start your projects by defining your business goals.

- **Enhanced automation and integration**: Integrating Dynamics 365 with existing business processes allows for seamless automation of tasks, workflows, and data exchanges, reducing manual effort, errors, and cycle times.

- **Improved data accuracy and visibility**: Standardized processes and data governance practices ensure consistent data entry, integrity, and accessibility within Dynamics 365, facilitating accurate reporting, analysis, and decision-making.

- **Scalability and adaptability**: Agile and adaptable business processes supported by Dynamics 365 enable you to scale your operations, accommodate growth, and respond quickly to changing market demands or regulatory requirements.

- **Continuous improvement**: Dynamics 365 provides powerful analytics, reporting, and monitoring capabilities that allow you to identify performance bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for process optimization.

Create a process management team when you implement Dynamics 365 to help ensure the implementation is successful while also creating a culture of continuous improvement and optimized processes.
