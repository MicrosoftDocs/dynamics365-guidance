# Architecture for composable commerce with Dynamics 365 Commerce for e-commerce success

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Commerce***

Composable commerce lets businesses deliver flexible customer experiences across platforms and devices, and it's changing e-commerce solutions. This article explains options for e-commerce architecture with Dynamics 365 Commerce, defines headless and composable commerce, compares them, lists benefits, and describes how composable commerce transforms e-commerce. Learn how composable commerce creates new opportunities for businesses to grow and adapt quickly.

## Design options for commerce architecture

You can customize your e-commerce platform in three ways:

- A **Monolithic** architecture tightly couples all components and is an outdated approach.
- A **Headless** architecture lets you build and update the front end and back end separately, so it's easy to adapt to market changes.
- **Composable** commerce lets you choose different components from various vendors to create a tailored e-commerce setup that fits your needs.

## Headless commerce

*Headless commerce* is an e-commerce architecture where the front end (the *head*) and the back end (the *body*) are separate. It's the accepted term for decoupled commerce software architecture, where the system's front end is separate from the back end business logic. In a traditional e-commerce setup, the front end, which includes the user interface and presentation layer, is tightly connected to the back end, which handles business logic, databases, and server-side operations.

Headless commerce is part of the composable commerce approach, where an e-commerce platform communicates with other apps and services using an API-first approach. These tools include apps and services like payment solutions, analytics tools, loyalty programs, and search engine solutions.

> [!TIP]
> The terms *headless commerce* and *composable commerce* are often used interchangeably.

## Composable commerce

*Composable commerce* is a modern way to build e-commerce systems. It separates the front end (what customers see) from the back end (how the store works). Unlike older systems, where everything is tightly connected, composable commerce lets these parts be developed separately. This approach makes it easier for businesses to update and customize their platforms quickly without affecting other areas.

Traditional e-commerce systems often come as one big package, making it hard to change one part without affecting everything else. Updating the look and feel or user experience can take a lot of time and be complicated. Composable commerce solves this problem, making it easy to add new features or update designs without causing issues elsewhere.

### Benefits of composable commerce

A decoupled setup like composable commerce gives businesses flexibility and agility, so they can quickly adjust to changes in customer preferences. By keeping the front end and back end separate, companies ensure a consistent look, feel, and functionality across all channels—whether it's a website, mobile app, social media, voice engagement, or loyalty program.

Composable commerce also improves scalability and performance, so businesses can handle more traffic and sales without slowing down their websites. This approach leads to faster loading times and a better user experience.

### Benefits for customers

With composable commerce, customers get a smooth, personalized experience no matter how they interact with a brand—through a website, mobile app, voice assistant, marketplace, or social media. Faster loading times and better performance create a responsive, user-friendly interface. Customers use products and services easily from any device, like a desktop, smartphone, tablet, or voice assistant. This consistent, cross-channel experience meets today's customer expectations and makes shopping convenient and enjoyable. Dynamics 365 Commerce lets businesses deliver this seamless, connected experience.
