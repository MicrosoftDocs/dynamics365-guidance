# Introduction to Dynamics 365 implementation tools and samples

On Microsoft Learn, Microsoft publishes guidance to help implement solutions with Dynamics 365 apps. We've also started new content for tools and samples that we provide in [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics-365-FastTrack-Implementation-Assets/tree/master). This article provides an overview of the tools and samples.

## Overview

In this section, we provide an overview of the resources in the Dynamics-365-FastTrack-Implementation-Assets GitHub repo. <!--INFO: Paragraph tries to work around Linter issue but doesn't work.-->

The Microsoft FastTrack team for Dynamics 365 set up the [Dynamics-365-FastTrack-Implementation-Assets](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics-365-FastTrack-Implementation-Assets/) GitHub repo to share best practices and shortcuts for Dynamics 365 implementation projects. The tools and scripts are sorted by the Dynamics 365 apps that they support, or the technology or concept that they apply to.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft doesn't actively maintain all the resources in the [Dynamics-365-FastTrack-Implementation-Assets](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics-365-FastTrack-Implementation-Assets/) repo. We recommend that you test each resource in a pre-production environment before you use it in production.

The following table outlines the contents of the repository.
