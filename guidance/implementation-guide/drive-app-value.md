# Drive long-term business application value through digital transformation

The articles in this section outline our approach to digital transformation and discuss strategies for shortening the time to value, cutting through the noise, and focusing on business outcomes with Dynamics 365.

With cloud applications constantly evolving and business needs changing all the time, your business applications need to keep up so that they're consistently delivering value. Dynamics 365 solutions run in the cloud, often as software as a service (SaaS), and fully support the changes of the modern world. That means that you can focus on your business, and not on the technology, as you take advantage of the latest innovations and capabilities that are delivered to you automatically.

An organization's digital transformation involves different phases and levels of maturity. A green field implementation could start with a pilot or a minimum viable product (MVP) that's targeted at a specific business process, then expand incrementally with new business processes and more capabilities for users. Alternatively, replacing an existing system might mean that a significant amount of functionality needs to be available at the start to have parity.

No matter where you start, realizing the long-term goals of a SaaS-based digital transformation requires effective planning. In this section, we explore how to create a digital transformation roadmap for your organization. The roadmap can help accelerate the time to value while maintaining relevance in a constantly changing technology and business landscape. This guide can help you navigate the challenges of expanding your solution and drive continuous, long-term business value.
