# Overview of the Prospect to quote business process areas

***Applies to: Dynamics 365, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Sales***

The *Prospect to quote* process is broken down into business process areas. The following sections further describe the business process areas.

## Manage customer relationships

Maintain communication, and address concerns throughout the sales process. Dynamics 365 Sales provides a centralized place for tracking interactions, tasks, and activities with prospects and customers. Therefore, it helps ensure a seamless and personalized customer experience.

## Identify and qualify leads

Find potential customers, and assess their value. Dynamics 365 Sales provides tools for managing and qualifying leads, such as lead scoring and automated workflows. In this way, it helps ensure that your sales team focuses on the most valuable prospects.

## Define sales strategy and policies

Set goals and create a plan to achieve sales objectives. With Dynamics 365 Sales, you can define and track sales targets, territories, and quotas. This way, you gain insights into your sales performance and guiding the overall sales process.

<!-- ## Run marketing campaigns

Use marketing campaigns to attract potential customers. Dynamics 365 Sales can integrate with Dynamics 365 Marketing to help you create, manage, and track campaigns. Ultimately, campaigns drive lead generation for the prospect-to-quote process.

## Analyze sales

Gain insights from service delivery to improve future sales efforts. While Dynamics 365 Sales primarily focuses on sales processes, it can be integrated with other Dynamics 365 applications such as Customer Service and Field Service to give you a comprehensive view of your service operations.
