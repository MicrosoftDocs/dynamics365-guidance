The terms categorization, merchandising, and segmentation of products and services are all related concepts. Although all three terms are often used interchangeably, they do have distinct meanings and functions in the system as well. The following list outlines the differences:

- *Categorization* refers to the process for grouping products or services based on shared characteristics.  
- *Segmentation* refers to the process of dividing a market (of typically customers) into smaller groups (or segments) based on shared characteristics or interests.  
- *Merchandising* refers to the process of presenting products or services in an appealing and attractive way to the customers.
