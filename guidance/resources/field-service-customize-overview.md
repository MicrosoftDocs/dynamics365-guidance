## Undocumented custom controls

Field Service introduces controls that are intended to be used only as-is on the forms that use them by default.

Don't use the following controls in customization scenarios:

- MultiselectLookupControl
- msdyn_postponegenerationuntil: Internal use only. Manipulating values in this field or taking dependencies on it isn't supported and can lead to unexpected system behavior. This field is found in the following entities:

    - Agreement Booking Setup (msdyn_agreementbookingsetup)
    - Agreement Booking Date (msdyn_agreementbookingdate)
    - Agreement Invoice Setup (msdyn_agreementinvoicesetup)
    - Agreement Invoice Date (msdyn_agreementinvoicedate)
    - Order Invoicing Setup (msdyn_orderinvoicingsetup)
    - Order Invoicing Setup Date (msdyn_orderinvoicingsetupdate)
    - Order Invoicing Date (msdyn_orderinvoicingdate)
    - Incident Types Setup (msdyn_incidenttypessetup)
    - Quote Booking Setup (msdyn_quotebookingsetup)
