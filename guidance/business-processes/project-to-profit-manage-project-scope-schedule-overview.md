# Define your resources for projects with the manage project resources business process area

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Project Operations***

This article describes how you can use Dynamics 365 products to define your resources for a project and schedule your costs and revenue.

Resources and the schedule are critical during the project lifecycle. The ability to track these two types of information helps ensure that your project is in a healthy state. To get started, define a baseline at the beginning of your project. Then, during the project's lifecycle, refine that baseline through estimation to complete by adjusting the resources and schedule.

As a project manager, you should first collect requirements, define the project scope, and plan the project, including all required costs and generated revenue.
Once you have all these elements, you can create and define the first budget baseline to follow. During the project lifecycle, you should periodically reassess the resources and schedule to ensure they reflect changes, and validate that your project is profitable according to the baseline.

This business process should be defined and incorporated into the overall implementation during the project planning phase, which is typically the first step of your project.

## Stakeholders

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of the *Manage project resources and schedule* business process area. The following list provides examples of these stakeholders:

- Project manager
- Audit department
- Finance department
- Executive sponsor

## Manage project resources and schedule process flow

The *Manage project resources and schedule* business process flow is illustrated in the following diagram.

Each solid gray rectangle in the diagram represents an end-to-end business process, while the solid blue rectangle represents a business process area. The arrows show the flow of the business process in an organization, with parallel subprocesses shown as branches if a subprocess can lead to more than one other subprocess.

The flow diagram covers the following steps.

1. Start
1. *Project to profit* end-to-end process
1. *Govern projects* business process area
1. *Manage project resources and schedule* business process area

    1. *Collect project requirements*.
    1. *Define project scope*, including deliverables.
    1. *Plan project*.
    1. *Validate resources and schedule*.
    1. *Create project*.
    1. *Create work breakdown structure*, including all required costs (resources, materials, fees, and so on) and dependencies.
    1. *Update estimates to complete*. First, define the baseline. Then, on a periodic basis, refine the estimates to complete.
    1. *Monitor scope delivered*, and review the progress of your deliverables.
    1. *Control resources and schedule*, and review whether you adhere to the plan or have deviations from it.
    1. *Revise resources and schedule*, and update the resources and schedule according to project's events.

1. End

## Manage project resources and schedule benefits

There are many key benefits that can be used to monitor and measure the success of implementing technology to support the *Manage project resources and schedule* business process area. The following sections outline the key benefits that an organization might monitor and measure for *Manage project resources and schedule*.

### Delivery excellence

Define your deliverables,  and use a work breakdown structure to define how you will achieve them through resources, items, expenses, and fees. This process helps organizations validate that they have appropriate expertise to deliver the project. Dynamics 365 Project Operations provides features that give you the right information.

### Tracking efficiency

Dynamics 365 Project Operations provides advanced project tracking features that enable organizations to manage the resources and schedule. By using a work breakdown structure, budget, and forecast, you can follow costs and revenue in real time.

### Accurate profitability

Dynamics 365 Project Operations provides capabilities such as statements, control, and an integrated dashboard to help organizations control the profitability of a project or a range of projects. Real-time visibility into profitability enables organizations to make the right decisions.
