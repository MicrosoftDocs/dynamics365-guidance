# Agent for automated routine queries

***Applies to***: ***Dynamics 365 Customer Service***

This agent reduces contact center costs by deflecting routine inquiries to intelligent self-service AI agents. These AI agents can work across channels while providing instant 24/7 customer responses and can intelligently assess if there is a need to really involve a human agent. Customer could choose to start small by automating even just one intent or case category.
