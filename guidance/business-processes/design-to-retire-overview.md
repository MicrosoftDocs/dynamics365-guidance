This article describes the *design to retire* end-to-end business process flow and its relationship to other business processes that can be used in Dynamics 365.

## Design to retire process relationship

The following diagram shows the relationship of other processes and products/features for the *design to retire* process. The *design to retire* process covers the process for introducing new *tangible products*. Learn more about bringing *services* to market at [Concept to market end-to-end overview](concept-to-market-overview.md).

The upstream processes for the *design to retire* process include the following.

- **Forecast to plan**: Organizations often complete the product definition in the *design to retire* process before they begin the forecasting process.
- **Prospect to quote**: In some operational strategies, such as engineer to order, the *prospect to quote* process occurs before the *design to retire* process, because the quote is often the trigger that initiates the process.
- **Order to cash**: In some operational strategies, such as engineer to order, the *order to cash* process occurs before the *design to retire* process, because the quote is often the trigger that initiates the process.
- **Project to profit**: In some operational strategies, such as engineer to order, the *project to profit* process starts before the *design to retire* process. For example, before the organization begins to set up and procure the items to produce the product, it creates the project, defines the budgets, and completes and approves drawings. Additionally, when organizations use projects to manage capital projects, the project definition, budgets, and so on, are typically set before the organization begins to create and procure the required products.

The *design to retire* end-to-end process is broken down into the following business process areas.

- Define product catalog and strategy
- Introduce new products
- Define product costing
- Define product pricing
- Manage product lifecycle

The downstream processes for the *design to retire* end-to-end process include the following.

- **Procure to pay**: Typically, products are purchased after an agreement is made with a vendor and the product is defined in the system. In organizations that manufacture products, the products that must be purchased are often defined by the engineering process that is part of the *design to retire* process. In some cases, the request for quotation process occurs before a product definition is created. In these cases, the *procure to pay* process is upstream instead of downstream.
- **Prospect to quote**: In operational strategies such as make to stock, the *prospect to quote* process occurs after a product mix is determined in the *design to retire* process.
- **Order to cash**: In operational strategies such as make to stock, or in brick-and-mortar commerce scenarios, the *order to cash* process occurs after a product mix is determined in the *design to retire* process.
- **Plan to produce**: Except in operational strategies for make to order and engineer to order, the production process typically occurs after the *design to retire* process is completed. Nevertheless, because there are often updates throughout the production process, the process can be both upstream and downstream.
- **Project to profit**: In project-based organizations, the project can be integrated with the supply chain to create purchase orders or item requirements that are shipped to the customer in a downstream process after the item is defined.
- **Inventory to deliver**: The *inventory to deliver* process can occur only after the product exists in the system. The product is a key prerequisite for tracking inventory information such as receipts, issues, and movements.
- **Case to resolution**: The *case to resolution* process is downstream to the *design to retire* process when you use cases to manage inventory issues, vendor issues, customer complaints, and so on.
- **Record to report**: The *record to report* process is downstream to the *design to retire* process, because items and orders must exist before costs or revenues can be recognized in the general ledger, for example.

## Featured capabilities

Product-specific capabilities are offered that interact with the *design to retire* process. These capabilities include, but aren't limited to, the following list.

- **Product catalogs**: Dynamics 365 Commerce includes catalog features to help manage products in retail channels. Additionally, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes both internal and external catalogs to help with the procurement process. External catalogs are sometimes referred to as punchout catalogs. They help maintain product information from a third party.
- **Product assortments**: Product assortments are used in Dynamics 365 Commerce to assign different products to different retail channels.
- **Product attributes**: Product attributes are used to enrich product information in Dynamics 365 Commerce and Supply Chain Management.
- **Product categories**: Product categories are used to help create channel navigation in Dynamics 365 Commerce (for example, for site navigation). You can also use product categories in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to help manage and analyze your spend and revenue across the application.
- **Engineering change management**: For manufacturing companies or organizations that need tighter control over the onboarding of new products, the *Engineering change management* module helps manage the workflow and data validation for the setup of new products, bills of materials (BOMs), formulas, and routes.
- **Product translations**: If you sell or buy products in different countries or regions, you can translate your product descriptions. You can also define vendor-specific or customer-specific item numbers. In this way, you help make communication with your customers and vendors easier.
- **Product templates**: You can use product templates to quickly and easily create new products that have similar information.
- **Product configurator**: If you have many options for a single product, as is common in industries such as the automotive industry, you can use the product configurator to define an unlimited number of options. The product configurator includes logic for controlling which options and combinations are allowed for a product. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management supports dynamic updates to the BOM or route. There is also support for calculating the price of a product based on the options that are selected during order entry.
- **Lot (batch) and serial number control**: You can define products so that they are controlled by a batch number, which is often referred to as a lot number. This approach provides better inventory tracking and visibility throughout the system. Additionally, you can control when a batch or serial number is required. In this way, you ensure that users maintain the quality of data that's required for your operations at every movement of the product.

## Design to retire business process flow

The following diagram shows the high-level flow of the *design to retire* business process. [!INCLUDE [daf-business-process-e2e-flow-def](~/../shared-content/shared/guidance-includes/daf-business-process-e2e-flow-def.md)]

The following steps are illustrated in the *design to retire* end-to-end business process flow diagram.

1. Start
1. *Design to retire* end-to-end process
1. *Define product catalog and strategy*
1. *Introduce new products*

    1. *Manage product costing*
    1. *Define product pricing*

1. *Manage product lifecycle*

    1. *Procure to pay*
    1. *Prospect to quote*
    1. *Order to cash*

1. End

Parallel branches from 5.a. *Procure to pay*, 5.b. *Prospect to quote*, 5.c. *Order to cash*, and 5.d. *Plan to produce* connect to *Inventory to deliver*, which connects to *Record to report* and then to 6. End.

Parallel branches connect from Start to each of the following upstream end-to-end processes, all of which connect to 4. *Introduce new products*.

- *Forecast to plan*
- *Prospect to quote*
- *Order to cash*
- *Project to profit*
