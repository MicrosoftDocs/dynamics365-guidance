# Checklist for Dynamics 365 implementation project performance

Use this checklist to make sure your Dynamics 365 implementation projects are focused on performance.

| Done? | Task |
|---------|---------|
|&check;| Establish that the responsibility to deliver an acceptably performing solution is shared by the cloud service provider and the implementation partner that customizes and extends the out-of-the-box application. |
|&check;| Design, develop, and test for performance in accordance with the service boundaries. |
|&check;| Include performance as part of the requirement conversation. Make sure it's reflected in the design and the development of the solution, with specific documented goals that are tracked through future change requests. |
|&check;| Establish development, user experience, and information architecture guidelines that create a positive perception of performance, prioritizing application responsiveness and user experience. |
|&check;| Understand that user perceptions of performance are the result of an accumulation of factors, including network latency, device performance, browser add-ins, firewalls, and proxies. Establish the performance baseline in the context of the actual user environment and location. |
|&check;| Make sure performance testing considers realistic loads and actual usage scenarios. |
