# Checklist for implementing cloud solutions

## Adopt a cloud mindset

| Done? | Task |
| :---: | --- |
| &check; | Transform your business processes with SaaS applications and features that add value right away and let you improve continuously. |
| &check; | Don't recreate your legacy on-premises user experiences in the cloud. |
| &check; | Make sure everyone involved, from the executive sponsor to the developers, knows the business impact of the solution. |
| &check; | Organize your data estate and know how the new solution affects it. |
| &check; | Get approval from information security and compliance for the cloud platform and the data category you use. |
| &check; | Make sure your teams understand how to administer, operate, support, and monitor the platform. Also make sure your policies, processes, and patterns are cloud ready. |
| &check; | Use DevOps and CI/CD pipelines to automate your build, testing, and deployment. |
| &check; | Design your solution within the service boundaries and licensing capacity, and know how to expand and scale it if needed. |
| &check; | Design your solution to meet the nonfunctional requirements, such as network latency, user environment, and devices. |
| &check; | If you move an on-premises solution to the cloud, make sure your data model, design, and quality are good enough for the cloud. Don't bring over poor design or data that could slow down your cloud adoption. |

## Customize and extend

| Done? | Task |
| :---: | :--- |
| &check; | Know the value and impact of each extension you make to the application. For example, how does it affect data-driven decision making, efficiency, automation, and user adoption? |
| &check; | Follow the guidelines for when and how to customize and extend the out-of-the-box apps. Only use the documented extension techniques. |
| &check; | Don't change or repurpose the out-of-the-box tables and data models. You could lose the ability to use new features and capabilities in the future. |

## Operation

| Done? | Task |
| :---: | :--- |
| &check; | Make sure you have the expertise you need to support and evolve your solution after deployment. You can use a partner (system integrator) or your own teams. |
| &check; | Stay connected with the community to keep up with the latest innovation and influence the product direction. You can use channels, events, blogs, and other mediums. |
