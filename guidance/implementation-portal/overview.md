# What is the Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal?

[Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal](https://aka.ms/D365ImplementationPortal) helps you implement solutions with Dynamics 365 successfully based on the [Success By Design](../implementation-guide/success-by-design.md) framework. The implementation portal provides tools to help you manage project data, project users, create reviews, and update project profiles. You also have access to implementation guidance that is tailored specifically to your project.  

The Implementation Portal navigation panel includes the following links:

* Engagements

  * Home
  * Projects
  * Create/Join project
  * Nomination (GCC)
  * Nomination

* Telemetry Insights
  * Set up telemetry
  * Telemetry recommendations
  * Data consent

* Help & Support

  * Knowledge Articles
  * Help
  * Contact Us
  * Privacy & Cookies

The following sections describe key components of the Implementation Portal.

## Projects

The **Projects** area in the Implementation Portal shows all projects that you have access to, either as a project user or as a project admin.

* Use the **My Active Projects** menu to switch between viewing your active and inactive projects.

* Select **Card View** to switch from a card view to a grid view of your active or inactive projects.

* Select a project name to open a page with more information about the project.

Learn more at [Manage projects](manage-projects.md).

## Create or join a project

The onboarding wizard makes it easy to create an implementation project in real time, so that you can receive implementation guidance and create reviews. You can also join an existing project if you're already part of it. The wizard guides you through the process of creating a project, adding users, and setting up the project details.  

Learn more at [Onboarding Wizard](onboard-project.md).

## Nomination

Here Microsoft partners can nominate projects for participation in the FastTrack program. Learn more at [Customer eligibility and partner qualifications](../fasttrack/eligibility.md).

## Telemetry Insights

Telemetry detects optimization opportunities and provides actionable guidance based on usage patterns within customer environments. Results surface with severity indicators as they require attention. Learn more at [Set up Telemetry Insights](telemetry-insights.md).  

## Knowledge Articles

Knowledge articles are scenario-based recommendations based on thousands of Dynamics 365 implementation projects that the FastTrack team has engaged with. Use the filters to select categories and articles to get recommendations for. Articles can have more than one scenario and corresponding recommendations.
