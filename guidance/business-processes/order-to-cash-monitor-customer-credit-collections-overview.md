# Support your organization’s business processes for monitoring customer credit and collections

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Finance Insights, Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights***

This article describes how you can use Dynamics 365 products to support your organization's business processes for monitoring customer credit and collections.

## Introduction to monitoring customer credit and collections

In many organizations, not least organizations with a business-to-business sales model, setting credit limits is an important process that helps organizations remain competitive. Credit limits can also help an organization minimize bad debt and the need to write off unpaid balances. When you manage the collection process carefully, it helps you get customers pay on time, increases the cash flow, and helps make the cash flow of the organization more predictable.

The process for monitoring customer credit and collections often splits into two main focuses in a Dynamics 365 project:

1. The first is around the master data configuration of your customers and the establishment of the credit limits, payment terms, and so on, for your customers.  
2. The second is the monitoring of orders and invoices for your customers to ensure that customers remain within their credit limits and rules your business has established to ensure that you can reduce the risk for fraudulent orders and accounts.  

## Using Dynamics 365 to monitor customer credit and collections

Dynamics 365 Finance includes functionality to help you manage your customer master data including establishing credit limits, credit scores, and so on. The Finance app can also help you monitor orders for fraudulent activity, reconcile the credit limits to the customers' balances, and place orders or customers on hold based on your business rules.

Large retailers, not least retailers that primarily do business online with consumers, typically have credit or fraud departments that monitor sales for fraudulent activity. Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection includes functionality to help customers manage fraud in three key pillars including account protection, loss prevention, and purchase protection. Fraud Protection uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help protect your business from fraud.

## Monitor customer credit and collections stakeholders

Many people in an organization must contribute to the decision-making process and design of the monitoring customer credit and collections process in your Dynamics 365 project. Stakeholders include the roles listed in the following list:

- Finance stakeholders – Examples: CFO, Controller, Accounting manager

- Accounts receivable stakeholders – Examples: Accounts receivable manager, Credit and collections manager

- Sales stakeholders – Examples: VP of sales, Sales Directors, General Managers

- Operations stakeholders – Examples: COO, Risk managers, Fraud managers
