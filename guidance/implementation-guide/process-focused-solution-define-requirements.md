# Define your requirements for your Dynamics 365 solution

Some projects start with lists of requirements that are based on isolated functional features. Without reference to mapped and documented business processes, these requirements can cause problems, such as:

- Missing process steps that are discovered too late.
- Misinterpretation of the requirement by parties who aren't experts in the related process.
- Lower business engagement in the project.
- Longer review cycles because the requirements and designs are less clear.

To avoid these problems, use business process mapping to define your requirements. Business process mapping is a method to draw the as-is processes that show how your business is running right now, and the to-be processes that show how it should work in the future. This approach emphasizes the importance of business process mapping early in the project.

After you determine what to keep, change, or add to your solution, create the list of requirements and align them to the business processes for an accurate picture. Use tools that help you track and manage the requirements.

Typically, in a process-focused solution, after you agree on the processes, you can derive the detailed requirements and map the relevant designs. Tools in Dynamics 365 can help. For example, Azure DevOps Services can help you create and track requirements, and Dynamics 365 Lifecycle Services includes Business Process Modeler (BPM), which can help you establish and implement processes.

The list of requirements is easier to create from the business process mapping and can be revised and refined iteratively.

## A solution that helps you improve your business operations

Designing and building a solution that has a great positive impact isn't an easy task. You must consider many aspects. Everything is so connected that even a small piece can influence the whole project.

The business process flows are the common ground where you can gather all the implementation artifacts. They keep all the solution components and phases aligned and connected. Business process flows are the main tool for communication that helps you drive changes on how your business runs and helps you minimize missing any pieces.

Business processes are involved throughout the implementation journey and remain useful for future improvements in your business. They have a lasting impact on your business, as long as you continuously revise them to align with your business goals and vision and reflect any changes in your solution.

By defining business process flows, you prepare a solid foundation for all the implementation activities. And at the end, you can enjoy the benefits of optimized and efficient processes, reduced risks, lower costs, role compliance, an integrated solution, and a successful implementation.
