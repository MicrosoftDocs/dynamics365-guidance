# Manage employee performance and growth

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Guides, Dynamics 365 Human Resources, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

This article describes the end-to-end business process to help managing employee performance and growth including learning, skills tracking and development, goal setting, and performance reviews.

Managing employee performance and growth is integral to the success of any organization, serving as a cornerstone for fostering a motivated and skilled workforce. In today's dynamic business landscape, Dynamics 365 plays a pivotal role in streamlining this process.

Specifically, Dynamics 365 Human Resources and Customer Voice synergize to provide a comprehensive solution. Dynamics 365 Human Resources facilitates the definition of performance and review processes, competency requirements, career paths, and learning plans. Meanwhile, Customer Voice helps in gathering valuable feedback, contributing to a holistic view of employee performance. This integration empowers organizations to align their workforce strategies with real-time insights, ensuring a more effective approach to employee development.

When you use Dynamics 365 Human Resources together with Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Supply Chain Management, or Field Service, you can manage the skills required to perform work including project work, production work, or field work. When you use Dynamics 365 Human Resources together with Dynamics 365 Commerce, you can manage the shifts and training for the frontline workforce in a brick and mortar or call center stores. Adding in Dynamics 365 Guides provides augmented reality to help train and upskill employees while using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist can be used to assist field workers in their work to monitor or upskill. While Dynamics 365 Customer Service includes features and ability to integrate with telephony system to monitor calls and monitor the customer service that is being delivered to customers.

Now, delving into the intricacies of managing employee performance and growth, a series of interconnected business processes come into play. These processes encompass defining performance and review procedures including the goal setting process and documenting employee performance. Skill management is broken up into several business process areas including establishing required competencies for roles, maintaining a repository of skills and competencies, analyzing gaps between skills required for the jobs to be done and the skills of the workforce.

The employee growth process including learning, and succession planning containing process areas such managing course offerings, creating learning plans, assigning courses, recording employee progress of assigned learning, and analyzing/reporting on employee learning. These processes also include outlining employee career paths and formulating succession plans. This comprehensive list of processes is supported within Dynamics 365 and help organizations not only automating but also optimizing the entire employee management lifecycle, promoting efficiency and strategic decision-making for organizations aiming to cultivate a high-performance culture.

The features and functionality for managing employee performance and growth aren't mandatory to run Dynamics 365 Human Resources; any of the features can be added at any time. Some downstream features such as skills competencies may be required for downstream scheduling processes, for example, in Dynamics 365 Field Service, Project Operations, and Supply Chain Management. In these cases, the skill definition and management processes should be planned earlier in the project to define the flow of data for the downstream processes.

## Stakeholders

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of the *Manage employee performance* area. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

- **Human resources leaders and management stakeholders** include HR managers, talent development managers, and learning and development specialists. These stakeholders collaborate closely with competency management and succession planning stakeholders to ensure alignment with organizational goals throughout the design and implementation phases.

- **Competency management stakeholders** include competency analysts, job role designers, and career development specialists. These stakeholders are responsible for actively contributing to the design and testing phases, ensuring that defined competencies align with organizational needs and job requirements.

- **Succession planning stakeholders** include succession planners, leadership development managers, and talent acquisition specialists. These stakeholders play a key role in the design phase, ensuring that succession plans align with organizational objectives and talent development strategies.

- **Learning and development stakeholders** include training coordinators, learning experience designers, and employee development coaches. These stakeholders are integral during testing, ensuring that training modules and courses effectively address defined competencies and career paths.

- **Performance management stakeholders** include performance appraisal managers, employee relations specialists, and performance metrics analysts collaborate closely with HR leaders in the implementation phase, overseeing the rollout of defined performance management processes.

- **Skill gap analysis stakeholders** include skills assessment coordinators, data analysts, and HR business partners actively contribute to testing and refining analytical tools during the design and implementation phases to ensure accurate skill gap analysis.

- **Managers and supervisors stakeholders** include team leads and department heads. These stakeholders play a pivotal role in executing performance reviews, helping goal-setting, and providing ongoing feedback to employees. They actively participate in the performance management process, ensuring that individual goals align with broader organizational objectives and contribute to employee growth. Additionally, they collaborate with HR leaders to document and review employee performance, fostering a culture of continuous improvement within their teams.
