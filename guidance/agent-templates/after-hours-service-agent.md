# After Hours Service Agent

Provides 24/7 customer support while protecting on-call engineers from unnecessary interruptions. Reduces on-call fatigue and costs by intelligently triaging after-hours requests, pre-screening to escalate only true emergencies while handling routine inquiries through self-service or scheduling for next business day.

## Overview

Agent answering after-hours calls, responding to chat and emails using AI to assess issue severity through conversational triage. Asks diagnostic questions, searches knowledge base for solutions, and applies business rules to determine true emergencies. Non-critical issues receive self-service guidance or scheduled callbacks. Emergencies trigger on-call engineer notification with full context via SMS, email, or Teams.
