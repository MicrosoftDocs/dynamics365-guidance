This article introduces the concept to market end-to-end business process for managing the lifecycle of services. It outlines how Dynamics 365 products can help service-based organizations manage and optimize their service lifecycle management processes.

## Concept to market management overview

*Concept to market* is the process of managing a service offering from its inception to its eventual end of life. The process typically begins with the development of a service offering idea, which is then refined and tested to ensure it meets customer needs. Once the service is launched, it is important to monitor its performance and make necessary adjustments to keep it competitive in the marketplace. As the service offering matures, it may be necessary to update or refresh the design to maintain customer interest. Eventually, the service offering may reach the end of its marketable life, and it will be retired from the market. Throughout this process, the *concept to market* process requires careful attention to customer needs, market trends, and technological advancements to ensure the service offering remains relevant and successful.

In service-based organizations or organizations that sell services alongside tangible products, Dynamics 365 offers a variety of products to help support the design and development of new service offering and to control the downstream transactions that occur in the organization. For example, when you use Dynamics 365 Field Service, you can define service offering that are sold by using Dynamics 365 Sales or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. For complex services such as professional services, you can use Dynamics 365 Project Operations to help manage the lifecycle of your customer relationship, the definition of the services can be defined in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management or Dynamics 365 Sales. You can mix and match services with tangible products on orders as well, and include services in your production process, or outsource services with Procurement and sourcing, Project Operations, or Field Service, just as a few examples.

Every organization has variations to the *concept to market* process. Here, we define the basic outline for any organization looking to implement a technology solution to support the *concept to market* process for services.

## Impact

The *concept to market* process can have a significant impact on an organization's overall operations and effectiveness. A well-designed process can help organizations to streamline service offering development, improve collaboration between teams, and ultimately deliver high-quality services to market faster.

By managing the entire service offering lifecycle in a single system such as Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management or Dynamics 356 Field Service, organizations can reduce errors and delays caused by manual data entry or communication breakdowns between teams. This can lead to more efficient development cycles, as teams can quickly access and share service offering information, identify issues, and make necessary changes.

Moreover, the tools and features available in Dynamics 365 can help organizations to better understand their service offerings and their performance throughout their lifecycle. This can help organizations to identify opportunities for cost savings, process improvements, and optimization of resources. By analyzing sales data, organizations can gain insights into how to improve service offering design.

## Stakeholders

The implementation of Dynamics 365 to support the concept to market process requires involvement from multiple stakeholders across the organization. Below are some of the key stakeholders that should be involved in the implementation:

- **Product development stakeholders**: This team is usually at the forefront of creating new service offerings. They are responsible for conceptualizing, designing, and developing the new services. This team often includes product managers, designers, and developers who work together to bring the service to life.

- **Marketing stakeholders**: Marketing plays a crucial role in the design of new service offerings. They conduct market research to identify customer needs and preferences, define the target audience, and create messaging and branding strategies to promote the new service.

- **Sales stakeholders:** The sales team is responsible for understanding customer feedback and market demands. They can provide valuable insights into what customers are looking for in new services and help shape the offerings accordingly.

- **Customer Service/Support stakeholders:** Feedback from existing customers is essential in designing new services. The customer service or support team can provide insights into common customer issues and areas where new services can address these concerns.

- **Research and Development (R&D):** For organizations involved in more advanced or technology-driven services, an R&D department may be responsible for the development of innovative features and technologies that can be incorporated into new services.

- **Finance stakeholders**: The finance department plays a critical role in determining the financial feasibility of new service offerings. They assess the potential costs, pricing strategies, and revenue projections to ensure the new service is financially viable.

- **Operations and logistics stakeholders**: Once a new service is designed, it needs to be implemented efficiently. The operations and logistics team is responsible for planning how the service will be delivered, including supply chain management, distribution, and logistics.

- **Legal and compliance**: Depending on the industry and the nature of the service, legal and compliance teams ensure that the new service offerings meet all regulatory requirements and legal standards.

In summary, the involvement of multiple stakeholders is critical for the successful implementation of Dynamics 365 to support the *concept to market* process. A cross-functional approach is needed to ensure that the system is properly configured, integrated, and optimized to meet the needs of the business.

## Concept to market benefits

When your organization plans to implement Microsoft Business Applications to assist with the *concept to market* process, there are several benefits the solution can help provide. These key benefits should be used to determine if the solution is a good fit for your business and to drive the specific business requirements for implementing the solution. As a side effect, these benefits can be used to create a baseline for your goals and objectives for the project so that you can measure the success of implementing solutions to meet those business requirements.

### Improved collaboration and productivity

When you use Dynamics 365 together with Microsoft Teams and Office 365 you can improve collaboration between teams by providing a centralized platform for managing service offering information. This can help to reduce errors and delays caused by manual data entry or communication breakdowns between teams. Additionally, by automating manual processes for service offering development, organizations can increase productivity and optimize resource utilization. By using Dynamics 365 organizations can also be more agile and responsive to changing market needs by providing real-time visibility into service offering development.

### Streamlined process efficiency

When you use Dynamics 365 together with Power Automate, you can automate and streamline various stages of the concept-to-market process, reducing manual tasks and improving overall process efficiency. This can result in quicker time-to-market for new services. For example, you can use Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to quickly onboard new products, gather all the right data to start testing and selling the services. When you use Dynamics 365 Marketing, you can create customer journeys and automate marketing like emails, upselling, and cross-selling in various channels to create interest and draw in existing or prospective customers.

### Better quality and compliance

By managing the entire service offering lifecycle in a single system, organizations can identify and address quality issues early in the development cycle, reducing the risk of damage to the organization's reputation. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management and Field Service can also help organizations to improve compliance with regulatory requirements by providing a centralized platform for managing service offering information and ensuring that products meet regulatory standards.

### Increased competitive advantage 

Implementing Dynamics 365 and the Power Platform to support the concept to market process can give your organization a competitive edge by enabling faster response to market trends and customer needs, helping you stay ahead of competitors. For example, when you use Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, you can get valuable insights into how services are performing to allow you to adjust. Additionally, if you use Project Operations to manage your service offerings as projects with your customer, you can get valuable information about services, risks, and more that can all be easily tracked in the same system.
