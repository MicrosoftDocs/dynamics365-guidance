1. Start

    A parallel process that isn't shown connects to an upstream business process area for *Introduce new products*. This box connects to 4.b.i. *Assign product attributes*.

            A parallel branch connects to *Introduce new products*, which has parallel branches to each of the following end-to-end scenarios:

            1. *Order to cash*
            1. *Plan to produce*
            1. *Source to pay*

            Each of these downstream end-to-end processes connects to *Record to report*, which connects to End.

        1. *Determine product mix for a retail channel*
        1. Is update required?

            1. Yes leads to *Maintain product catalog*.
            1. No leads to End.

    1. *Determine product attributes*

        1. *Assign product attributes*
        1. Is update required?
