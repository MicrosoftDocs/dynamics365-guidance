# Solution architects in Dynamics 365 implementations

A solution architect is responsible for the successful design, implementation, deployment, and adoption of an overall solution. A solution architect makes sure that the solution meets the organization’s needs now and in the future.  

Solutions architects use their technical expertise to integrate and optimize technologies across an organization, tailoring solutions to meet developer and business needs. Specifically for Dynamics 365, solution architects tend to specialize in scenarios within the following areas:

- Customer engagement  
- Finance and operations  
- Core platform  

They help organizations find the right configuration of services from Microsoft and third-party providers to suit that organization's needs.  

For example, a solution architect is an expert on warehouse processes, while another is an expert on continuous implementation/continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes with Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions.  

In this example, both solution architects might work for Microsoft. Alternatively, one works for a customer of Microsoft's, and they collaborate to get the solution right for that Microsoft customer.  

If you're already a solution architect and familiar with Dynamics 365, then stop reading here, and go on with your work. But if you're considering becoming a solution architect, then do continue.  

## Get started

Maybe you're an IT professional who wants to grow skills in cloud technologies. Maybe you've worked with Dynamics AX for years, and your organization wants to migrate to Dynamics 365. Maybe you're exploring options to make the new solution right for your organization. Or you're interested in helping organizations find a solution that's right for them now and in the years to come.
