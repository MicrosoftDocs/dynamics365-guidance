# Checklist for driving app value in Dynamics 365 implementation projects

## Approach to digital transformation

| Done? | Task |
| :-----: | ---- |
| &check; | Understand the core business model and how the application you're developing affects the key elements of the business model. |
| &check; | Clearly state and communicate your business transformation goals with specific measurable key performance indicators (KPIs). |
| &check; | Make sure the implementation team understands the business processes in scope and the business teams are closely involved to optimize the process where needed. |

## Change stream

| Done? | Task |
| :-----: | ---- |
| &check; | Consider the various change streams that will affect the project and adjust your budget and timelines accordingly. |

## Transformation roadmap

| Done? | Task |
| :-----: | ---- |
| &check; | Create an effective minimum viable product (MVP) scope that goes beyond the bare minimum to speed up value realization. |
| &check; | Define your transformation roadmap and structure the phases to maximize time to value and drive maximum business impact. |
| &check; | Identify the expansion models and include them in your project phases. |
| &check; | Adopt the latest capabilities to deliver continuous innovation to the business. |
