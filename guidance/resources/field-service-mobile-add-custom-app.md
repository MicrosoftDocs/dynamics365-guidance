# Add a custom app module to the Field Service mobile app

We recommend using the standard Field Service Mobile app module. However, sometimes organization wants to give frontline workers access to another custom app module to enable other business use cases and processes.

Custom app modules don't contain all of the out-of-box business logic, such as booking travel-time calculations, which exist in the standard Field Service Mobile app module.

## Create a custom app module

Create a custom app module based on the Field Service Mobile app module. Reuse components and sitemap of the Field Service Mobile app module, as a starting point from which you can customize your experience.

1. In Dynamics 365, go to the list of your app modules and select **+ Create New App**.

1. **Create a New App** opens the app designer. Enter the **Name** and other optional detail. Expand **Advanced** and **Use components from a custom solution**. Set *Field Service* as the solution *Field Service Mobile* as the sitemap. Select **Create**.

1. Your new app module contains all standard Field Service Mobile app module entities. You can now add items to the sitemap and customize your app module.

1. After adding items to the sitemap, **Publish** the app module.

## Make the custom app module available in the mobile app

Once the custom app module is created, you need to update the mobile app player that can access the app module.

To make the app module available to the Field Service mobile app:

1. In the App Designer, select **Settings**.

1. Under **General**, expand **Advanced settings**.

1. Set the value of **Primary Mobile Player** to *Field Service (Dynamics 365)*.

1. Close the settings dialog and **Save and Publish** your app module.

You can now find the custom app module in the app picker screen after signing in to the Field Service mobile app.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't see the app module:
>
> - Make sure users have a [predefined security role](/power-platform/admin/database-security) in the environment that the app is in. If a predefined security role is assigned to a user using a Dataverse team, you need to use a Microsoft Entra ID group team. Users don't see model-driven apps if a predefined security role is assigned using a Dataverse owner team.
> - Check the roles assigned to the app module and ensure the user accessing the app module has the same role.
> - In sandbox environments, ensure "Show non-production apps" is enabled in the mobile app.
