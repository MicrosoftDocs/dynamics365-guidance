# Design for performance with FastTrack

You want your Dynamics 365 solutions to run fast and smooth. That's good for you, your customers, and your project success. But how do you make sure your solution design supports your performance goals? That's where [Microsoft FastTrack](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/fasttrack/) can help.

FastTrack offers a workshop that focuses on designing your solution for performance. It helps you understand how configuration and customization affect the solution's overall performance and user experience. It also shows you how to prioritize performance activities, set performance goals, and test performance throughout the project.

## What you'll learn in the workshop

The workshop covers the following topics that help you incorporate performance considerations into your delivery plan and allocate enough resources to the project:

- Data volumes: Estimate workload and integration volumes to make sure expectations are within limits and aligned with intended product usage.

- Geolocation strategy: Determine where your users and servers are located to identify any network challenges.

- Key business scenarios: Identify the areas of your business that need high performance.

- Extension performance: Review planned customizations to make sure they follow best practices.

- User experience performance: Make sure that changes to the user interface follow best practices.

- Performance testing: Develop and document performance goals and a testing strategy to measure performance.

## When to schedule the workshop

We recommend that you schedule the performance workshop before you start designing your solution. Or, do it as soon as you can after you have detailed information about your performance requirements and testing strategy. If you wait too long, you might have to redo some of your work based on the workshop findings and recommendations.
