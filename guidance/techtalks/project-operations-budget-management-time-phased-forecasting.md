# TechTalk: Budget management and time-phased forecasting with Dynamics 365 Project Operations

In the world of project-based service delivery, effective budget oversight and accurate forecasting can make a difference between profitability and loss. With the latest enhancements in Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Microsoft introduces powerful capabilities for budget management and time-phased forecasting—bringing clarity and control to project financials across two major deployment scenarios: light deployment and resource/non-stock deployment.

We based this article on [a TechTalk](https://youtu.be/jb3MTTa2-xs?si=4awJGEDTOWHvRnve) that you can find online in the Dynamics 365 channel on YouTube.

## Introducing budget management across project lifecycles

This update introduces a comprehensive budget management framework designed to support organizations at every stage of a project—from initiation and planning to execution and closeout. By enabling teams to define project budgets at the outset and monitor consumption in real time, the framework ensures stakeholders can proactively manage cost overruns and steer projects toward financial success.

Users can create budgets directly from project contracts or quotes, streamlining the planning process and maintaining alignment with customer commitments. Additionally, budgets can be allocated across work breakdown structure (WBS) tasks, enabling granular visibility and ensuring accountability at the task level. This foundational capability supports better tracking, especially in multi-task or multi-phase engagements, giving teams a real-time view of where funds are going.

## Enabling time-phased forecasting for greater insight

One of the most impactful innovations in this release is the introduction of time-phased forecasting. This feature allows organizations to project costs, revenues, and margins throughout a project's timeline. By visualizing financial flows in phases, project managers can better anticipate financial inflection points, seasonal resource shifts, or billing cycles—driving more accurate financial planning and reporting.

The time-phased model is closely integrated with actual project transactions, ensuring forecasts remain dynamic and adapt based on real-time progress and actual data, supporting agile financial management. Whether it's planning cash flows, tracking margin erosion, or preparing executive reports, this capability enhances both visibility and responsiveness.

## Seamless integration with cost control and actuals

In Dynamics 365 Project Operations, budget and forecast data are interconnected with actuals, seamlessly incorporating information from timesheets, expense entries, purchase orders, and vendor invoices. This unified view empowers financial stakeholders to perform ongoing variance analysis and adjust forecasts accordingly.

As project activities progress, the system consistently updates budget consumption and forecast data, providing decision-makers with a precise and up-to-date view of financial health. This integration diminishes the dependence on offline tools such as spreadsheets and minimizes the likelihood of discrepancies between planned and actual financials.

## Supporting both light and resource-based deployments

This feature is versatile, catering to various operating models. Microsoft designed it to enhance both light deployments, which emphasize time tracking and invoicing, and resource/non-stock deployments, where cost tracking and subcontractor management are essential. While production-based (stocked) deployments do support budget management, they aren't covered in this session.

Regardless of your organization's setup, the budget and forecasting tools are designed to scale and adapt, whether you're managing internal resource plans or external vendor contracts.

## Looking ahead: Evolving project financial intelligence

With these enhancements, Microsoft is advancing towards smarter and more integrated project management experiences. The combination of flexible budgeting tools, real-time actuals integration, and forward-looking forecasting enables businesses to reduce financial risk, make better decisions, and align project execution with financial goals.

Future updates continue to strengthen financial intelligence within Project Operations, including improvements to multi-currency handling, reporting, and deeper integrations with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) capabilities.

## Conclusion

Budget management and time-phased forecasting are critical tools for modern project-driven organizations. With these capabilities now embedded in Dynamics 365 Project Operations, businesses gain the visibility, control, and agility needed to thrive in today's competitive service economy.
