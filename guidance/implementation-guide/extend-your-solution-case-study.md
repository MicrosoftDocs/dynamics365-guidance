# Extensibility strategy case study

Let's look into an example of how a customer used the extensibility capabilities to enrich their solution.

## Story

A wealth management services company that delivers personalized services had the need to standardize, simplify processes, drive efficiencies, expose more data, and increase visibility and interoperability to their users.

## Case study

Having evaluated solutions, the company decided to build a modern, customized, cloud-based solution on Dynamics 365.

With the off-the-shelf capabilities, the users achieved a single view of the customer lifecycle across all products. Through customizations and specific extensions of the solution, the company added special wealth management services and customized the user experience to better serve their customers.

This extension helped the company streamline processes, increase revenue, reduce costs, enhance transparency, and manage regulatory compliance, and allowed the users to better understand each customer's story, goals, and capacity for risk. The company was able to deliver appropriate, innovative, high-value services and products to maintain successful end-to-end customer journeys across every account.

The power of using off-the-shelf capabilities and yet customize and extend the experience set the foundation to improve their internal processes. As a result, their users could finally deliver better services in a more efficient matter.
