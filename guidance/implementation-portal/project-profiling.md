# What is a good profile in the Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal?

In this article, we describe what a good profile is, and how you can profile your project well.

## Profile details

A good profile in the Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal is important because it helps both you and Microsoft ensure that the proper context is available for guidance and proactive support. Project and customer specifics such as the complete list of products being implemented and the features for each of them. Characteristics are also important. Implementation guidance is tailored to your project based on information in the profile. You can update the project profile on the ​*Project Profile* tab.

## Keep the profile current

A good profile should also specify the products, features, and characteristics, primarily size, complexity, and growth characteristics of the implementation project. We suggest adding the profiling as it is known when the project is created and keeping the profile updated as the project scope and detail changes through the implementation. Keeping the profile updated at regular intervals as changes happen, to match the reality of the project when appropriate is recommended. 

Here are some examples of what to include in a good profile:

- ​**Products**: All the products in scope for the implementation project.
- **Features**: Features that are being implemented for the products in the project.
- **Size**: The number of users who will be using the system, the number of locations where the system will be deployed, and the amount of data that will be processed.
- **Complexity**: The number of customizations required, the level of integration with other systems, and the level of data migration required.
- **Growth**: The expected growth rate of the system, the expected number of users, and the expected number of locations.
- **Other characteristics**: As detailed as feasible. Any information allows the portal to tailor specific proactive information relevant to the project.

On the other hand, a bad profile is one that is incomplete or lacks detail. For example, a profile that only specifies the products and wouldn't be very helpful in tailoring implementation guidance to the project.

If you're a partner in the Partner Portfolio Model, good project profiling across projects lifts the portfolio score.

## How to profile

Here are the step-by-step instructions for profiling a project in the Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal:

1. Sign in to the Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal using your work account or personal Microsoft account.

2. In the left side panel, select Projects.

3. Select the project you want to manage.

4. The Project Profile tab gives you an overview of all the details of the project. You can switch between read-only and editable views of the Project Profile tab.

5. Use the project profile to specify the products and features in the implementation project, their features, and other characteristics. Implementation guidance is tailored to your project based on information in the profile. 

6. When you select a product, the page shows the product's features. 

7. Select Done to save your changes. A notification at the top of the page tells you that implementation guidance will be based on the changes you made. When the message "Guidance is generated successfully" appears, select the Implementation guidance tab to view refreshed recommendations.
