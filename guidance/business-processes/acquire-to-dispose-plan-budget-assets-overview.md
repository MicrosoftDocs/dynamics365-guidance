# Support your organization’s business processes for planning and budgeting assets with Dynamics 365

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

This article describes how you can use Dynamics 365 products to support your organization's business processes for planning and budgeting assets.

## Introduction to plan and budget assets

Companies generally use capital assets, whether tangible or intangible, to run business operations. The planning and budgeting of assets are crucial factors in determining the financial stability of a company. By forecasting the costs that are associated with acquiring, maintaining, and replacing assets, and by estimating the expenses and cash flow requirements, an organization helps ensure that it has enough funds for the maintenance budget.

Often, businesses use historical data to plan and budget new asset purchases. If the business is new, the planning of asset requirements might require deeper understanding of aspects such as the following list:

- The business model
- The long-term and short-term growth model
- Requirements from different business units
- The overall market strategy

A structured approach to the planning and budgeting of assets is an indicator of a mature organization that aims to reduce uncertainty and risks through effective asset management and maintenance. As a result, the stakeholders gain the confidence to invest in the vision and goals of the company.

## Plan and budget assets stakeholders

Many people in an organization must contribute to the decision-making process and design of the *plan and budget assets* process in your Dynamics 365 project. Stakeholders include the roles in the following list:

- **Asset managers** – Responsible for managing the lifecycle of assets.
- **IT department** – Responsible for maintaining and testing technology solutions.
- **Finance department** – Responsible for tracking asset costs.

## Plan and budget assets benefits

The following sections outline the key benefits that an organization might measure for *plan and budget assets*.

### Refined asset planning process

A well-planned process for purchasing, deploying, maintaining, and disposing of assets year over year helps organizations build a strong asset planning and budgeting strategy. Subsequent budgets can have better data, so that the organizations can plan for future requirements of assets and their maintenance.

### Optimized resource allocation

Planning and budgeting require evaluation of both the needs of the business and the condition and performance of the existing assets. As a result, organizations get a holistic picture of the cost-effective strategy for either replacing assets or reallocating them where they can be more efficient.

### Risk management

With effective planning and budgeting of assests, organizations can assess potential risks, such as redundant assets, equipment failures, end-of-life software, and any noncompliant practices. This information can help them create a proactive maintenance and replacement plan that can reduce the operational risks and, in turn, optimize asset lifecycle.

### Improved asset lease management

With Dynamics 365, organizations can more effectively manage leased assets as a lessee. Capabilities such as the following are built in:

- Lease accounting
- Lease management
- Lease portfolio analysis

These capabilities and others can help organizations reduce the risk of lease errors, improve lease compliance, and achieve cost savings. Learn more at [Asset leasing home page](/dynamics365/finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-homepage).
