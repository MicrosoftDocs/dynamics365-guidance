## The power of Adyen and Dynamics 365

Adyen is a global payment service provider that offers businesses the ability to accept payments across multiple channels and regions. Adyen is a full-service platform that includes everything from the gateway and processor to acquiring services. Adyen is an end-to-end solution and eliminates the need for multiple external vendors, reducing complexity, costs, and potential inefficiencies.

When you add this payment connector to your Dynamics 365 Commerce solution, Adyen becomes the only payment provider natively embedded in the system. This way, it's easier for businesses to set up and manage their payment processes. This out-of-the-box integration ensures that companies using Dynamics 365 can quickly implement Adyen's payment services with minimal configuration.

## Seamless payment integration

One of the key strengths of the Adyen and Dynamics 365 partnership is the seamless integration it provides for businesses operating in global markets. The unified platform allows companies to manage both online and in-store payments from a single system, making it easier to reconcile transactions and gain insights into customer behavior across different channels.

Adyen supports over 150 payment methods globally, meaning businesses can cater to a wide range of customer preferences without needing multiple integrations. Whether it's Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, or Google Pay, Adyen has businesses covered, ensuring they never miss a sale due to payment restrictions.

## Real-world use cases

Many major brands rely on the Adyen and Dynamics 365 integration to power their global payment operations. One example is a large North American retailer that transformed its fragmented payment system by adopting the Adyen Payment Connector. This move simplified their payment processing by consolidating everything onto one platform, leading to faster transactions, improved customer insights, and streamlined reconciliation.

Before they adopted Adyen, the retailer faced significant challenges in handling its complex payment infrastructure. With multiple vendors involved in different aspects of the payment process, reconciling payments across channels was time-consuming and prone to errors. After they switched to Adyen, the company experienced an 87% year-over-year growth in payment volume, with over $11 billion processed through the system in a single year.

## Key benefits of the payment connector

One of the most significant advantages of using the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen is the speed and ease of implementation. Businesses can configure the connector in just a few hours, allowing them to focus on their core activities rather than dealing with lengthy integration processes.

The integration also provides enhanced support and troubleshooting. Since both Microsoft and Adyen maintain the integration, businesses don't need to navigate complex support channels. Any issues are handled directly between Microsoft and Adyen, ensuring fast resolution and minimal downtime.

Additionally, businesses using Adyen gain access to cutting-edge features, including *buy online, pick up in-store* (BOPIS) and *buy online, return in-store* (BORIS) functionalities. These unified commerce flows allow companies to deliver a more seamless customer experience, which is crucial in today's omnichannel retail environment.

## Handle payments in challenging scenarios

The Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen also offers a solution for businesses that need to process payments during network outages. The "store and forward" feature allows terminals to store transaction details and process them once the connection is restored. Additionally, Adyen terminals can switch to cellular networks to ensure continuous payment processing during internet downtime.

This reliability is essential for businesses that operate in areas with unstable internet connections. It also helps in high-traffic retail environments where system failures could lead to significant revenue losses.

## Omnichannel capabilities

The Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen supports a range of omnichannel payment scenarios, allowing businesses to start a transaction in one channel and complete it in another. It's not least important for retailers that offer services like BOPIS or ship-from-store, where a customer might order a product online and pick it up in-store or vice versa.

To ensure smooth omnichannel operations, businesses need to configure the payment system for each channel—whether it's online, in-store, or via call centers. The Payment Connector ensures that the same payment methods and configurations are available across all channels, providing a consistent experience for customers and staff alike.

## Adyen payment terminals and fleet management

Adyen also offers a wide range of payment terminals, from mobile POS devices to more traditional countertop terminals, all of which are fully compatible with the Dynamics 365 environment. These terminals support various payment methods and are designed to be future-proof, with automatic updates to ensure they remain compliant with the latest payment regulations and methods.

For larger businesses with multiple locations, Adyen's Terminal Fleet Manager provides centralized control over all payment terminals, simplifying everything from ordering new devices to configuring existing ones. This self-service functionality helps reduce the administrative burden of managing payment hardware across multiple stores or regions.

## Conclusion

The Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen is a powerful tool for businesses looking to streamline their payment processes across multiple channels and regions. Its integration with Dynamics 365 Commerce provides a seamless, out-of-the-box solution that eliminates the need for multiple external vendors, reducing costs and complexity.

With support for over 150 payment methods and advanced features, such as store and forward, unified commerce flows, and terminal fleet management, Adyen ensures that businesses can deliver a frictionless payment experience to their customers—whether they're shopping online, in-store, or over the phone.
