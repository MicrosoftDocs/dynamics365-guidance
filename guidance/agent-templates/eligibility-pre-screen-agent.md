# Agent for prescreening financial health and eligibility

***Applies to***: ***Dynamics 365 Customer Service***

Eliminates repetitive back-and-forth communication by autonomously collecting required information, documents, and data from customers before processing requests. Ensures due diligence completion, reduces processing delays, improves data quality, and allows representatives to focus on qualified, ready-to-process requests with complete information.

## Overview

This agent template is for a conversational AI agent that guides users through a structured information collection process. The agent asks contextual questions, validates responses, requests required documents, and checks for preliminary eligibility or compliance. The agent uses conditional logic to adapt questions based on customer responses, tracks completion status, sends automated reminders for missing items, and only escalates to representatives when all requirements are satisfied.
