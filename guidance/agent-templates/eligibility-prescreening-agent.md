# Financial Health / Eligibility Pre-Screening Agent

Eliminates repetitive back-and-forth communication by autonomously collecting required information, documents, and data from customers before processing requests. Ensures due diligence completion, reduces processing delays, improves data quality, and allows representatives to focus on qualified, ready-to-process requests with complete information.

## Overview

Conversational AI agent guides customers through structured information collection processes, asking contextual questions, validating responses, requesting required documents, and performing preliminary eligibility or compliance checks. Agent uses conditional logic to adapt questions based on customer responses, tracks completion status, sends automated reminders for missing items, and only escalates to representatives when all requirements are satisfied.

## Key benefits
