# Overview of the Plan projects business process area within the Project to profit end-to-end scenario

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Project Operations***

This article represents a business process area that replaces another that was deprecated. We're still in process of updating the article.

This article describes how you can use Dynamics 365 products to define your resources for a project and schedule your costs and revenue.

Resources and the schedule are critical during the project lifecycle. The ability to track these two types of information helps ensure that your project is in a healthy state. To get started, define a baseline at the beginning of your project. Then, during the project's lifecycle, refine that baseline through estimation to complete by adjusting the resources and schedule.

As a project manager, you should first collect requirements, define the project scope, and plan the project, including all required costs and generated revenue.
Once you have all these elements, you can create and define the first budget baseline to follow. During the project lifecycle, you should periodically reassess the resources and schedule to ensure they reflect changes, and validate that your project is profitable according to the baseline.

This business process should be defined and incorporated into the overall implementation during the project planning phase, which is typically the first step of your project.

## Stakeholders

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of the *Plan projects* business process area. The following list provides examples of these stakeholders:

- Project manager
- Audit department
- Finance department
- Executive sponsor

## Plan projects process flow

The *Plan projects* business process flow is illustrated in the following diagram.

Each solid gray rectangle in the diagram represents an end-to-end business process, while the solid blue rectangle represents a business process area. The arrows show the flow of the business process in an organization, with parallel subprocesses shown as branches if a subprocess can lead to more than one other subprocess.

## Plan projects benefits

There are many key benefits that can be used to monitor and measure the success of implementing technology to support the *Plan projects* business process area. The following sections outline the key benefits that an organization might monitor and measure for *Plan projects*.

### Delivery excellence

Define your deliverables,  and use a work breakdown structure to define how you will achieve them through resources, items, expenses, and fees. This process helps organizations validate that they have appropriate expertise to deliver the project. Dynamics 365 Project Operations provides features that give you the right information.

### Tracking efficiency

Dynamics 365 Project Operations provides advanced project tracking features that enable organizations to manage the resources and schedule. By using a work breakdown structure, budget, and forecast, you can follow costs and revenue in real time.

### Accurate profitability

Dynamics 365 Project Operations provides capabilities such as statements, control, and an integrated dashboard to help organizations control the profitability of a project or a range of projects. Real-time visibility into profitability enables organizations to make the right decisions.
