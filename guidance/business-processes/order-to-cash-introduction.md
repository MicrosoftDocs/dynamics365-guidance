### Increase sales

Implementing a technology solution alone is not likely to increase your organization sales volume or revenue.

This benefit may be achieved through simpler user interfaces, improved approval processes, automated steps, or better integration with other systems in your technology eco system.  

### Improve cash flow

For real-time visibility into your cash flow, apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to the data you have in your systems. This way, you get predictive analytics to see what the cash flow outlook is over future periods. Couple these insights with tools to help automate the collection process, and productivity tools to make your collectors and accounts receivable teams more efficient to improve the cash flow.

For example, virtual agents or chat bots can help answer questions about products and services, or you might have an easy-to-use commerce website for customers.
