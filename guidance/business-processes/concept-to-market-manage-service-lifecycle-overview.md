This article describes how you can use Dynamics 365 products to help manage the lifecycle of the services that your organization offers to customers or purchases from service providers.

In the dynamic landscape of today's business environment, effective management of the service lifecycle is paramount for organizational success. This fact is particularly true for nontangible services, regardless of whether they're offered to customers as a service or purchased from a service provider. The process of managing the service lifecycle plays a crucial role in ensuring that services are aligned with organizational goals, remain competitive, and consistently meet or exceed customer expectations.

Dynamics 365 offers a robust suite of products, including Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Sales, Field Service, Project Operations, and Supply Chain Management. Collectively, these products empower organizations to streamline and enhance their service offerings. Furthermore, the integration of Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and Guides provides a unique opportunity for optimizing services by applying augmented reality and step-by-step guidance to enhance efficiency and ensure a seamless service lifecycle.

The process of managing the service lifecycle encompasses several essential business processes that are pivotal for sustained success. Organizations that use Dynamics 365 can seamlessly analyze service performance by applying real-time data and analytics to make informed decisions.

Optimization of services is facilitated through continuous improvement initiatives, adaptation to changing market demands, and enhancement of overall service efficiency. Up-to-date service details are imperative for maintaining accuracy and relevance, and they ensure that the organization remains agile and responsive. When the time comes to retire a service, Dynamics 365 provides a structured approach that helps organizations make informed decisions about discontinuation or replacement.

Together, these processes form a cohesive framework that empowers organizations to navigate the intricacies of service management and deliver exceptional value throughout the entire service lifecycle.

The business processes for managing the service lifecycle in a Dynamics 365 implementation should be addressed in the early to mid-design and configuration stages of the project.

## Stakeholders

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of the *manage service lifecycle* business process area. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

- **Service leadership stakeholders** include service managers, the director of services, or the vice president (VP) of services. As key decision makers, these stakeholders define the strategic direction of service offerings and align them with organizational goals. Service managers oversee the entire service lifecycle and ensure that it meets business objectives and customer expectations.
