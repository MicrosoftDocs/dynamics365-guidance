# Manage service resources overview

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Guides, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist***

The *Manage service resources* area is part of the *Service to cash* end-to-end business process. This article tells you what this area is about, why you should use Dynamics 365 to support it, and what subprocesses it includes.

In the *Service to cash* end-to-end business process, resources are things that you can schedule for service delivery. The most common resources are people. But resources can also be other things like equipment, facilities, or anything else that has limited capacity and needs to be scheduled for service delivery.

The *Manage service resources* business process area covers the tasks you need to do to set up and maintain your resources. You need resources for service delivery, so you must set them up in the app before you deploy it. Plan to identify and define your resources when you discover and plan your implementation. This way, you can document your requirements for managing service resources.

You usually need to update your service resources often, so remember that you must maintain them in the app as part of your regular administration and management tasks. Plan to assign these tasks as part of your initial implementation.

## Stakeholders

Many people in your organization should help with the decision-making and design of the *Manage service resources* area. Here are some examples of such people:

- **Operations stakeholders** such as the COO
- **Field service stakeholders** such as service managers, service supervisors, and dispatchers
- **Billing and account management stakeholders** such as the Director of Finance
