# Manage employee performance and growth

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Guides, Dynamics 365 Human Resources, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

This article explains how to use the end-to-end business process *manage employee performance and growth* to help with employee learning, skills tracking and development, goal setting, and performance reviews.

Managing employee performance and growth is essential for any organization that wants to foster a motivated and skilled workforce. In today's dynamic business landscape, you can use Dynamics 365 to streamline this process.

Dynamics 365 Human Resources and Customer Voice work together to provide a comprehensive solution. You can use Dynamics 365 Human Resources to define performance and review processes, competency requirements, career paths, and learning plans. You can also use Customer Voice to gather valuable feedback that contributes to a holistic view of employee performance. This integration helps you align your workforce strategies with real-time insights, ensuring a more effective approach to employee development.

When you use Dynamics 365 Human Resources with other apps such as Project Operations, Supply Chain Management, or Field Service, you can manage the skills required for different types of work such as project work, production work, or field work. When you use Dynamics 365 Human Resources with Commerce, you can manage the shifts and training for the frontline workforce in brick-and-mortar or call center stores. You can also use Dynamics 365 Guides to provide augmented reality training and upskilling for employees. And you can use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist to help field workers in their work or monitor their skills. Finally, you can use Dynamics 365 Customer Service to monitor calls and customer service quality.

Managing employee performance and growth involves a series of interconnected business processes. These processes include defining performance and review procedures such as goal setting and documenting employee performance. They also include skill management processes such as establishing required competencies for roles, maintaining a repository of skills and competencies, and analyzing gaps between skills required for the jobs and the skills of the workforce.

The employee growth process includes learning and succession planning processes such as managing course offerings, creating learning plans, assigning courses, recording employee progress in assigned learning, and analyzing and reporting on employee learning. These processes also include outlining employee career paths and formulating succession plans. These processes are supported within Dynamics 365 and help you automate and optimize the entire employee management lifecycle. This promotes efficiency and strategic decision-making for organizations that want to cultivate a high-performance culture.

You don't have to use all the features and functionality for managing employee performance and growth in Dynamics 365 Human Resources. You can add any of the features at any time. However, some downstream features such as skills competencies might be required for downstream scheduling processes in apps such as Field Service, Project Operations, and Supply Chain Management. In these cases, you should plan the skill definition and management processes earlier in the project to define the flow of data for the downstream processes.

## Stakeholders

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of the manage employee performance area. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:
