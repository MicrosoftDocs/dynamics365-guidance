# Optimize your business processes with Dynamics 365

You can use business process mapping to find and seize opportunities to optimize your existing processes when you implement Dynamics 365.

## What is business process mapping?

Processes are the heart of every business. They describe how you operate and deliver value to your customers. A process is a series of tasks performed by different roles and units in your organization. Business process mapping represents these steps visually.

You can start by mapping your baseline or *as-is* processes. These are the processes you currently use or plan to use in a new solution or business model. You can find tips and templates for mapping your as-is processes from recognized organizations such as [American Productivity and Quality Center (APQC)](https://www.apqc.org/expertise/process-performance-management).

The level of detail in your as-is processes depends on their importance and scope. You don't need to define every step or system in your legacy processes. Instead, focus on the end-to-end scenarios and outcomes that matter to your business. Remember, your goal is not to replicate your legacy system in Dynamics 365, but to improve and innovate your processes.

The benefits of mapping your as-is processes are:

- You can define the scope and structure of your project in a clear and common language.
- You can communicate your project goals and vision using processes that your stakeholders understand and recognize.
- You can identify and highlight areas for process improvement, innovation, risks, and constraints.
- You can map your processes to the equivalent design in Dynamics 365 and measure the impact of your changes.
- You can create a workable definition of the project that doesn't rely on individual written requirements.

To map your processes effectively, you need the right people and tools. You need a business stakeholder who owns and leads the process in the operation. They can make the decisions about the process structure and investment. You also need one or more subject matter experts (SMEs) who know how the process works in the real world. They can provide the scenarios and variations for each process.

You can use any tools that help you draw and share your processes quickly and easily. For example, you can use sticky notes, pens, and whiteboards to start, and transfer the drawings and comments to more sophisticated applications later. The key is to make the process mapping interactive and visual, not a series of documents that require long approvals.

You should map your processes early in the project implementation. This helps you analyze the opportunities for improvement and create the right baseline for the project. You should also review and update your processes regularly to keep up with the changing needs of your business and the latest capabilities of the product.

## How to model your future processes

Digital transformation is fast and dynamic. Processes that work today might not be competitive tomorrow. Technologies like the cloud, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotic process automation, virtual reality, the Internet of Things, big data, virtual conference rooms, and many others create new possibilities and challenges.

When you review your processes, think about how you can use these technologies to improve your process outcomes and collaboration. You might find multiple areas in your processes that can benefit from modern options. Technology is a key differentiator. Don't fall behind your competitors who might be using these options to gain an edge.

## How to standardize your processes

You might also want to standardize your processes across different business units or regions. This means using the same or similar processes for the same or similar activities. Standardization can help you:

- Reduce costs by simplifying the processes that you need to implement, train, and maintain.
- Compare performance and results across different groups of users who execute the same process.
- Move resources within the organization more easily to meet changing demand.
- Adopt best practices and share knowledge across the organization. When one process improves, everyone benefits.

Standardization can also make your implementation easier and faster. After the first implementation, you have a proven case of a working process within your business. The next unit to be implemented can learn from the previous experience and adopt the process with minimal changes.

To standardize your processes, you need a good plan that aligns with your business strategy and model. You also need to consider the constraints and implications of standardization. For example:

- Standardization might benefit the organization as a whole, but might increase the workload or change the culture of a local unit.
- Standardization might require significant change management and communication.
- Standardization might not fit well with the industry standards or the Dynamics 365 capabilities. You might need to customize or compromise some aspects of the process.
- Standardization might not apply to the entire process. You might need to allow some variations or exceptions for local needs or preferences.
- Standardization might not outweigh the costs or risks of changing the process. You might need to reassess the business case and the expected outcomes.

You can use a "core template" approach to standardize your processes. This means creating a common process design that you can apply to different units or regions with minimal adjustments. You can use your process maps to create and communicate this template.
