# Drive expansion of business application in business-focused digital transformations

In previous articles, we showed you how to create a digital transformation roadmap for your business applications. You learned how to apply different approaches and techniques in the *Initiate* phase. But you can also use them later to expand your applications. In this article, we focus on how to grow the usage and scope of your business applications in various areas to achieve more business value and impact. We look at how expansion affects these aspects:

- Security and compliance
- Application lifecycle management (ALM)
- Administration and governance
- User readiness and change management
- Environment strategy
- Limits and capacity
- Data and integrations

## Users

One of the most common ways to expand a business solution is to add more users. This might happen when you bring new regions or countries to the same application. Adding users might seem simple, but it can have some challenges. For example, you might need to migrate data on a live system, meet different security and compliance requirements based on the region, or deal with other impacts.

## Mobile

Giving users access to multiple devices with offline capabilities can help with adoption. Sometimes, mobile access is part of the initial release; for instance, warehousing systems where workers need to scan goods when they pick them up. Other times, it might be a later update. Most built-in capabilities work in mobile apps, with more optimizations to support the mobile experience. For example, a sales mobile app offers the core features of the sales app with a mobile-friendly interface for field sellers.

## Incremental changes

Incremental changes are mainly driven by feedback and change requests from users and the business. These changes help ensure that the application meets the expectations of ongoing improvement and builds on the initial minimum viable product (MVP) to stay relevant. It's still important to evaluate these requests based on the business value and transformation goals.

## Feature adoption

As we discussed when talking about change streams, cloud products invest a lot in researching and implementing business capabilities that customers can easily turn on. It's a key benefit of the cloud, and it can play a major role in getting value from your investments. With continuous updates in Dynamics 365, new features are available to customers. A key business as usual activity is to analyze the new features and their technical impact on the existing solution and customizations. You must do this activity with key stakeholders. Most of these feature improvements are available to customers at no extra cost and can help move your application to the innovative or differentiator quadrant.

## New workloads

Dynamics 365 provides several business applications that are built on the same scalable Power Platform. As users adopt your application, you might find more opportunities to add related workloads that can help eliminate data silos by enabling stronger collaboration and data sharing. For example, if you add a marketing workload to your sales app, the sales team can see which nurture programs their customers are in and invite them to marketing events. Similarly, the accounts payable team can expand and move to a centralized accounts payable processing system. However, new workloads can have a significant impact.

## Satellite applications

When you deploy your business application, it covers core use cases and scenarios. Some of them might be relevant only to a specific team, region, or role. In such cases, you can deliver those targeted capabilities through a satellite application. Satellite apps are a good opportunity for user-developed apps and automations that use the data model of the core app. You can also use these apps for testing before adding them to the core app. Regarding the areas of impact, it's important to have strong governance around the data model and avoid creating more data stores that can lead to data fragmentation.

## Integrations

Integrations can play a key role in eliminating data duplication and improving data quality. Most importantly, they reduce the need for users to switch between multiple applications, which prevents context switching. The core integrations should be part of the initial phases and not left to future expansion phases. Even the built-in integrations with productivity applications like Microsoft 365 can boost adoption and make the information seamlessly available across apps while enabling stronger collaboration. However, you need to be careful. Integration can also cause performance issues and increase the overall complexity and cost of maintenance, so you need to use the right patterns and practices.

## Aggregation

Aggregation can help consolidate multiple business applications that have a lot of overlap in data and processes into a single application. Aggregation is different from integration. It completely replaces the application and brings the core features into an existing application instead of exchanging or embedding information. For example, a commercial banking sales system could become an aggregator for all nonpersonal banking sales systems.

The cutover approach for old applications is critical. Make sure to avoid parallel usage that can lead to data fragmentation and other aftereffects.

## Application standardization

This type of growth is driven by creating a generic application that isn't targeted at a specific process but a host of similar processes. The application could even provide a framework that lets the business onboard itself. This can achieve hyper-scale, where you can broadly categorize hundreds of processes or applications that serve more than one business process.

A general-purpose application allows scale, but it can require more training and user readiness, so you need to do it thoughtfully to be successful.

For example, consider a generic case management system that can handle hundreds of different case processes from different internal business functions that broadly involve similar steps. The business can create a team of resolvers, configure service-level agreements (SLAs), provide email notification templates, and create Microsoft Word or Excel templates to capture nonstandard data. But they can still use the generic app for core case management capabilities. All these actions have important considerations.

## Pivot

Pivots aren't necessarily expansion, but they can trigger major changes to an application, which could fundamentally change and broaden its scope. For example, a targeted Power Apps app used by a small team could go viral in an organization, and you need to pivot to make it an organization-wide application.
