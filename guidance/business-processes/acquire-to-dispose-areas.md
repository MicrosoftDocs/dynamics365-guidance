# Overview of acquire to dispose business process areas

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Business Central, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Dynamics 365 Guides, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist***

The *acquire to dispose* process is broken down into many business process areas. The following sections further describe the business process areas.

## Plan and budget assets

This business process area involves creating and managing budgets for acquiring and maintaining fixed assets, including identifying asset needs, estimating costs, and tracking budget performance. Budget plans can be generated from general ledgers, fixed assets, or project forecasts in Dynamics 365 Finance.

Planning and budgeting of assets also takes into consideration leasing of the assets, such as equipment or property, by evaluating leasing options, determining the lease threshold, and negotiating leasing terms.

## Acquire assets

This business process area involves acquiring fixed assets, such as equipment or property, by purchasing or leasing them, as well as securing rights for intangible assets such as trademarks, patents, and licenses. This process includes identifying asset needs, evaluating asset options, sourcing the assets, creating purchase or lease orders, and receiving and recording asset deliveries.

Newly acquired fixed assets, such as equipment or property, are created in the application as asset records with asset tags and asset details through either an invoice journal in the *Accounts payable* module or a fixed assets journal in the *Fixed assets* module in Dynamics 365 Finance, or through a purchase order in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. You can also manage and acquire fixed assets in Dynamics 365 Business Central.

The asset acquisition process also encompasses leasing assets from a lessor, negotiating lease terms, making lease payments, and complying with lease agreements. Asset leasing module in Dynamics 365 Finance enables the lessee to create legal contracts between the lessor and lessee. It provides the flexibility to create lease extension and expansion as well as create impairment transactions that use the right-of-use asset for non-recoverable costs.

## Manage internal assets

This business process area involves managing the day-to-day operations of fixed assets, including tracking asset usage, insuring the assets and optimizing asset performance. Management of internal assets also refers to managing leased assets by tracking lease payments and complying with lease agreements.

## Manage and report on asset financials

This business process area involves calculating and recording asset depreciation, amortization, and adjustments by looking at the earnings, maintenance costs and useful life value of the asset. This ensures accurate financial reporting of the asset's return of investment and compliance with accounting standards. Besides getting a pulse of whether the asset is performing at an optimal level, this business process area also enables the asset managers to analyze the maintenance costs for the internal and leased assets to optimize maintenance strategies.

## Maintain and repair internal assets

This business process area involves maintaining and repairing internal assets by creating work orders in Dynamics 365 Field Service. If the work order is tagged to a mixed-reality guide via Dynamics 365 Guides, the worker will be able to check if the guide is available through Dynamics 365 Supply Chain management mobile app and open it in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app. It is also possible to provide remote maintenance and conduct remote inspection with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist.

## Retire and dispose of assets

This business process area involves retiring and disposing of fixed assets that are no longer needed or need to be replaced. In Dynamics 365 Finance, disposal of a fixed asset can be done through fixed asset invoices or a fixed asset disposal journal while replacement or sale of an asset can be done through Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. The disposal of assets also triggers calculation of asset depreciation, write-offs, and losses, which is then accounted for in financial reporting.
