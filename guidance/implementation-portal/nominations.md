# Nominate projects for FastTrack

> The below steps are applicable only for public cloud projects. For Government Cloud projects, please submit the nomination using [this form](https://experience.dynamics.com/d365fasttracknomination/).

## Prerequisites

1. A project must already exist before you can nominate the customer. Microsoft uses the project profile to get the details about the project to automatically route to the right team.

2. Update the profile by adding as much information as possible in the **Products**, **Features**, and **Characteristics** sections, and then save the profile using the **Save** button.

  -  The **Characteristics** section has the important fields for nomination such as *Annual Dynamics 365 Revenue Spend*, *Number of users*, *Complexity*, and so on. Make sure that you profile the project with as much information as possible.

  Learn more about what makes a good profile at [What is a good profile in the Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal?](project-profiling.md).
