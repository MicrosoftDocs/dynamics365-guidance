# Define a strategy for adoption and change management

To implement your business solution successfully, you need to plan and manage how your organization will adopt and use it. Change is hard for any organization and requires careful planning and a structured approach. A change management strategy with a clear action plan helps you avoid common pitfalls, such as low adoption, poor usage, and misaligned expectations. Without a change management strategy, your business solution might become just a data entry tool instead of a valuable asset for your users.

## Align your business solution with your desired outcomes

Sometimes, projects meet the technical requirements but fail to deliver the expected business outcomes. This happens when there's a gap between the technology solution and the user experience. Change management helps you bridge this gap by supporting and equipping your users to adopt and use the new solution effectively. You need to involve different functions, including the project development teams, to make sure the user experience is a primary design consideration.

### Boost your project success rate

Microsoft uses the [Prosci Change Management methodology and tools](https://www.prosci.com/blog/spotlight-leader-of-change-management-at-microsoft) for its own and external projects. Prosci's research shows that projects with planned change management are six times more likely to meet their objectives than projects without it. The data is clear: the better you apply change management, the more likely you are to achieve your project goals.

To make your change management strategy successful, you need to cover these aspects:

- Ongoing executive sponsorship  
- Integration with the project management teams  
- Employee engagement  
- Frequent and open communication
