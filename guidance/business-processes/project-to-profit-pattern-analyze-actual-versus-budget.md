# Pattern for analyzing actuals versus budget

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Project Operations***

This article shows you how to compare actual project expenses to the budget. It's part of the *Measure project progress* business process in the *Analyze project performance* area in the *project to profit* end-to-end scenario.

## Context and problem

Compare actual project transactions to the budget to manage projects and oversee finances effectively. This helps you monitor spending in real time, spot budget deviations, and learn about project financial health. Analyze transactions regularly to catch potential cost overruns early, make informed decisions to reallocate resources, and take corrective actions to stay on track. This proactive approach helps you maintain financial discipline and finish projects within budget, supporting business success and profitability.

Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Project Operations help you streamline project transaction analysis by comparing actuals to budget. These integrated solutions show financial data and project metrics, so you track and analyze in real time. Dynamics 365 Finance helps you keep accurate financial records, automate financial processes, and stay compliant. Dynamics 365 Project Operations offers project management features like resource scheduling, project planning, and expense tracking. Together, these solutions help you make informed decisions, spot variances, and take corrective actions quickly, so projects stay on track and within budget. The integration between Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Project Operations creates a unified data platform, which lowers the risk of errors and discrepancies. This integration supports detailed reporting and analytics, giving you actionable insights that improve efficiency and profitability. Use these solutions to optimize financial and project management processes, leading to better project outcomes and business success.

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when:

- Plan and start a project. Early in the project, compare initial spending to the budget to make sure the project starts on the right financial footing.
- Monitor and report regularly. Throughout the project, compare actuals to the budget to check financial performance and quickly fix any differences.
- Review at major milestones. At key points, compare actuals to the budget to check if the project is on track financially and if you need to make changes.
- Evaluate at the end of the project. At the project's end, compare actuals to the budget to check overall financial performance and get data for future planning and budgeting.

This pattern isn't suitable for:

- Initial project setup. In the very early stages of a project, before significant transactions occur, comparisons can't give meaningful insights because there isn't enough data to check.
- Non-financial milestones. When you focus on non-financial parts of a project, like quality metrics, team performance, or customer satisfaction, budget comparisons aren't relevant.
- Fixed-price contracts. When the budget is set and can't change, focus on delivering within the agreed scope and timeline instead of comparing actuals to the budget.
- Minor expenses. For small, routine expenses that don't affect the overall project budget, detailed comparisons aren't needed and can create extra administrative work.

## Solution: Analyze project transactions by comparing actual to budget

Follow these steps to manage and control project finances, keep your projects within budget, and help your organization succeed.

### Procedure: Analyze project transactions by comparing actual to budget

Follow these steps to analyze project transactions by comparing actual to budget.

1. Set up project budgets.

    Define and enter the budget for your project, including all expected costs and revenue. You can do it in the project management module of Dynamics 365 Project Operations. Learn more at [Project forecasts and budgets](/dynamics365/project-operations/prod-pma/project-forecasts-budgets#project-budgets).

1. Record actual transactions.

    As the project progresses, record all actual transactions, such as expenses, time entries, and revenue, in Dynamics 365 Finance. Ensure that all financial data is accurately captured and categorized. Learn more at [Record financial transactions overview](record-to-report-record-financial-transactions.md).

1. Generate financial reports.

    Use the reporting tools in Dynamics 365 Finance to generate financial reports that detail actual project transactions. These reports should include all relevant financial data for the project. Learn more at [Generate financial reports](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/analytics/generate-financial-report).

1. Compare actuals to budget.

    Use the project accounting features in Dynamics 365 Project Operations to compare the actual transactions against the budget. You can do it through predefined reports or custom analytics dashboards. Learn more at  [Reevaluate the cost actual-to-budget association](/dynamics365/project-operations/pro/budget/reevaluate-actual-budget-association)

1. Analyze variances.

    Identify any variances between the actuals and the budget. Analyze the reasons for these variances, such as unexpected costs, changes in project scope, or inefficiencies. Learn more at [Variance visual](/dynamics365/finance/business-performance-planning/variance).

1. Take corrective actions.

    Based on the analysis, take necessary corrective actions to address any negative variances. It can include adjusting the project plan, reallocating resources, or implementing cost-saving measures. Learn more at [Create and confirm Correction journals](/dynamics365/project-operations/actuals/create-confirm-correction-journals)

1. Regular monitoring.

    Continuously monitor the project's financial performance by regularly comparing actuals to the budget. This ongoing process helps make sure that the project remains on track financially. Learn more at [Monitor and analyze project performance process area overview](project-to-profit-monitor-analyze-project-performance-overview.md).

## Issues and considerations

Consider the following points when you're deciding how to implement this pattern:

- Best practices
  - Schedule regular intervals to compare actuals to budget so you detect variances quickly.
  - Categorize all transactions accurately so you can compare them precisely.
  - Involve key stakeholders in the review process to gain diverse insights and ensure alignment with project goals.
  - Use insights from variance analysis to refine budgeting and forecasting processes for future projects.

- Cost considerations
  - Check licensing costs for Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Project Operations. Costs can vary based on the number of users and modules.
  - Check costs for implementing and customizing solutions to fit your business needs.
  - Budget for training staff and ongoing support so you use the systems effectively.

- Security considerations
  - Protect sensitive financial data with strong encryption and access controls.
  - Use role-based access controls to restrict access to financial data by user role and responsibility.
  - Make sure the systems comply with financial regulations and standards, like GDPR or SOX.

- Performance considerations
  - Integrate Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Project Operations seamlessly to avoid data silos and keep data flowing in real time.
  - Check if the solutions scale to handle more data and users as your business grows.
  - Monitor system performance so reports and analytics generate quickly.

- Non-functional requirements
  - Make sure the user interface is intuitive and easy to use so staff can adopt it quickly.
  - Choose solutions with high reliability and uptime so financial data is always available.
  - Use systems that are flexible so they adapt to changing business needs and processes.
  - Make sure support and maintenance are available so you can fix issues quickly.
