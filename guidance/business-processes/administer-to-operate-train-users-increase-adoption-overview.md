# Train users and increase adoption overview

***Applies to: Dynamics 365, Viva Learn***

This article describes the importance and tools available for training users and increasing adoption when implementing Dynamics 365 products.

Implementing a technology project, especially one as robust as Dynamics 365, demands more than just the deployment of cutting-edge software. A key determinant of success lies in the proficiency and engagement of the users involved. This is where the crucial aspects of training and adoption come into play.

Effective training not only empowers users to harness the full potential of Dynamics 365 but also plays a pivotal role in the overall success of the project. When users are proficient in using the tools at their disposal, they can contribute significantly to streamlined business processes and increased productivity.

Adoption, on the other hand, is the bridge that connects technology implementation to tangible business outcomes. It ensures that the tools introduced become an integral part of daily operations rather than mere additions to the digital landscape.

There are various tools available to help organizations who are implementing Dynamics 365 to assist with the training and adoption process.

- **Microsoft Learn**: Microsoft Learn stands as a cornerstone for training resources. It offers a diverse range of modules, tutorials, and hands-on labs tailored to Dynamics 365. This platform provides a structured learning path for users, enabling them to grasp the intricacies of the software at their own pace. Access training at [Dynamics 365 on Microsoft Learn](/training/dynamics365/).

- **Viva Learn**: Viva Learn, with its focus on learning and development, complements Dynamics 365 implementation seamlessly. Its interactive and personalized approach ensures that users not only acquire the necessary skills but also stay engaged throughout the learning process. Learn more at [Overview of Microsoft Viva Learning](/viva/learning/overview-viva-learning).

- **Product documentation**: Comprehensive product documentation serves as a valuable reference point. It acts as a go-to resource for users seeking detailed insights into the functionalities of Dynamics 365. Accessible and well-organized documentation contributes significantly to user self-sufficiency. Access product documentation at [Dynamics 365 documentation](/dynamics365/).

- **Change management and adoption tools**: Beyond specific learning platforms, incorporating robust change management and adoption tools is essential. These tools facilitate a smooth transition, addressing any resistance to change and ensuring that the new processes seamlessly integrate into the existing workflow. Find adoption resources at [Get ready to adopt Dynamics 365 apps](/dynamics365/adoption/).

- **Guidance from Dynamics 365 Implementation Guide and Success by Design**: In the Dynamics 365 Implementation Guide, organizations can find invaluable advice on crafting effective training plans and executing seamless change management. The Success by Design framework, embedded within the guide, offers a structured approach to implementation, emphasizing the importance of aligning technology solutions with business goals. Find the Dynamics 365 Implementation guide at [Dynamics 365 implementation guidance](../implementation-guide/overview.md).

- **Continuous training and evolution**: It's essential to recognize that training, change management, and adoption aren't isolated events. They're ongoing processes woven into the fabric of organizational evolution. As Dynamics 365 evolves, so should the skills and practices of its users. Regularly revisiting training plans and adapting change management strategies ensures that the organization remains agile in the face of technological advancements. See the roadmap at [Release plans for Dynamics 365, Power Platform, and Cloud for Industry](/dynamics365/release-plans/) or use the Release planner to help get organized for [upcoming software releases](https://releaseplans.microsoft.com).

Training and adoption aren't just procedural checkboxes in a project plan; they're the linchpin for realizing the true potential of Dynamics 365. Organizations acheive successful technology adoptions by using tools like Microsoft Learn, Viva Learn, and comprehensive documentation. These adoptions are done quickly and confidently when guided by the Dynamics 365 Implementation Guide and the Success by Design framework.

## Stakeholders

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of the *train users and increase adoption* business process area. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

- **Learning and development stakeholders** include learning and development managers, training specialists, and instructional designers. This team is responsible for crafting comprehensive training programs, designing learning materials, and conducting workshops to ensure users are proficient in Dynamics 365.

- **IT stakeholders** include IT managers, system administrators, and technical support specialists. The IT department ensures the technical infrastructure supports training initiatives, provides technical support during implementation, and collaborates with the learning and development team on technical training needs.

- **Change management stakeholders** include change management consultants, change analysts, and organizational change leads. This team develops change management strategies, communicates changes effectively, and assesses the impact on user behavior, addressing resistance to new processes.

- **Human resources stakeholders** include HR managers, talent development specialists, and employee relations coordinators. HR aligns training with organizational goals, facilitates communication, and monitors employee feedback and performance post-implementation.

- **End users**. These representatives provide insights on training needs, participate in pilot programs, and advocate for the benefits of Dynamics 365 within their respective teams.

- **Executive leadership** includes the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), and Chief Operations Officer (COO). Executive leadership provides strategic direction, allocates resources and budget, and reinforces the importance of adoption, ensuring alignment with organizational objectives.
