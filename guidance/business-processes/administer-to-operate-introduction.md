# Introduction to the administer to operate process for managing and optimizing Dynamics 365 solutions

***Applies to: Dynamics 365***

This article explains the *administer to operate* end-to-end business process. You'll learn how Dynamics 365 products can help you manage and optimize your Dynamics 365 solutions. This end-to-end business process has the number *99* in the business process catalog. Learn more at [About the business process catalog for Dynamics 365 apps](about.md).

## Administer to operate overview

*Administer to operate* serves as the linchpin for the sustained success of Dynamics 365 within organizational landscapes. Focused on the ongoing administration and optimization of existing solutions, this end-to-end business process entails a comprehensive approach to ensure the seamless operation of Dynamics 365. It's important to note that *administer to operate* primarily concentrates on post-implementation processes, with the Dynamics 365 Implementation Guide serving as a dedicated resource for initial deployment and installation guidance.

Within the *administer to operate* framework, various critical processes are orchestrated to maintain the health and efficiency of Dynamics 365 solutions. Encompassing a range of critical processes, this end-to-end business process involves defining business continuity plans, managing licensing and entitlements, administering system features, ensuring system access and security, training users for increased adoption, monitoring systems and capacity, managing background jobs and notifications, adopting software releases, overseeing data synchronization, ensuring system compliance, and providing responsive support.

While primarily addressing post-implementation needs, *administer to operate* plays a pivotal role in maintaining the efficiency, compliance, and adaptability of Dynamics 365 solutions, ensuring they continually align with evolving business processes and user requirements. For initial deployment and installation guidance, organizations can refer to the Dynamics 365 Implementation Guide, recognizing *administer to operate* as the cornerstone for ongoing optimization and resilience.

In summary, *administer to operate* encompasses a multifaceted approach to sustainably manage, optimize, and support Dynamics 365 solutions throughout their lifecycle, ensuring they remain aligned with organizational goals and responsive to evolving business dynamics.

Every organization has variations to the *administer to operate* processes. Here, we define the basic outline for any organization looking to implement a technology solution to support the *administer to operate* process with Dynamics 365.

## Impact

The impact of implementing the *administer to operate* end-to-end business processes within an organization using Dynamics 365 products is profound and far-reaching. Firstly, the meticulous definition of business continuity plans ensures that the organization is equipped to navigate unforeseen disruptions seamlessly, minimizing downtime, and safeguarding critical operations. Although Dynamics 365 is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, the system typically integrates with other systems and solutions in an organization, and understanding what Microsoft covers and protects and what organizations need to manage on their own is critical to an overall solution.

Effective management of licensing and entitlements optimizes resource allocation, maximizing the return on investment while aligning Dynamics 365 usage with evolving business needs. The administration of system features contributes to an agile and responsive technology infrastructure, adapting swiftly to changing organizational requirements. Rigorous control over system access and security enhances data integrity and protects sensitive information, instilling confidence in stakeholders.

User training initiatives foster increased adoption, empowering the workforce to use the full potential of Dynamics 365, ultimately driving operational efficiency. Ongoing monitoring of systems, environments, and capacity enables proactive identification and resolution of potential issues, ensuring optimal performance and user experience. The management of background jobs and notifications, coupled with the uptake of software releases, reflects a commitment to staying current with technological advancements, enhancing system capabilities over time.

Effective data synchronization and system compliance measures underscore the organization's commitment to data integrity and regulatory standards. Lastly, responsive support systems provide a safety net, addressing user queries promptly and troubleshooting issues, contributing to a resilient and smoothly functioning Dynamics 365 environment. In essence, the impact of *administer to operate* end-to-end business processes is transformative. These processes position organizations to not only adapt to change but to thrive in a dynamic business landscape through the continuous optimization of their Dynamics 365 solutions.
