## The power of Adyen and Dynamics 365

Adyen is a global payment service provider that gives businesses the capability to accept payments across multiple channels and regions. It provides a full-service platform that includes everything from the gateway and processor to acquiring services. Adyen's end-to-end solution eliminates the need for multiple external vendors. Therefore, it helps reduce complexity, costs, and potential inefficiencies.

When you add the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen to your Dynamics 365 Commerce solution, Adyen becomes the only payment provider that is natively embedded in the system. Therefore, businesses can more easily set up and manage their payment processes. The out-of-box integration ensures that companies that use Dynamics 365 can quickly implement Adyen's payment services after only minimal configuration.

## Seamless payment integration

One of the key strengths of the Adyen and Dynamics 365 partnership is the seamless integration that it provides to businesses that operate in global markets. Companies can use the unified platform to manage both online and in-store payments from a single system. Therefore, they can more easily reconcile transactions and gain insights into customer behavior across different channels.

Adyen supports over 150 payment methods globally. Therefore, businesses can cater to a wide range of customer preferences without needing multiple integrations. Regardless of whether customers want to use Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, or Google Pay, Adyen helps ensure that businesses never miss a sale because of payment restrictions.

## Real-world use cases

Many major brands rely on the Adyen and Dynamics 365 integration to power their global payment operations. For example, one large North American retailer transformed its fragmented payment system by adopting the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen. This move simplified the company's payment processing by consolidating everything onto one platform. The results were faster transactions, improved customer insights, and streamlined reconciliation.

Before the retailer adopted Adyen, it faced significant challenges handling its complex payment infrastructure. Because multiple vendors were involved in different aspects of the payment process, reconciliation of payments across channels was time-consuming and prone to errors. After the move to Adyen, the company experienced 87% year-over-year growth in payment volume. In a single year, more than $11 billion was processed through the system.

## Key benefits of the payment connector

One of the most significant advantages of using the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen is the speed and ease of implementation. Businesses can configure the connector in just a few hours. Therefore, they can focus on their core activities instead of lengthy integration processes.

The integration also provides enhanced support and troubleshooting. Because both Microsoft and Adyen maintain the integration, businesses don't have to navigate complex support channels. Any issues are handled directly between Microsoft and Adyen. This approach ensures fast resolution and minimal downtime.

Additionally, businesses that use Adyen gain access to cutting-edge features. These features include unified commerce flows such as *buy online, pick up in-store* (BOPIS) and *buy online, return in-store* (BORIS). Therefore, companies can deliver the seamless customer experience that is crucial in today's omnichannel retail environment.

## Handle payments in challenging scenarios

The Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen also offers a solution for businesses that must be able to process payments during network outages. Through the "store and forward" feature, terminals can store transaction details and process them after the connection is restored. Additionally, Adyen terminals can switch to cellular networks to ensure continuous payment processing during internet downtime.

The reliability that the solution offers is essential for businesses that operate in areas where the internet connection is unstable. It also helps in high-traffic retail environments where system failures could lead to significant revenue losses.

## Omnichannel capabilities

The Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen supports a range of omnichannel payment scenarios. Therefore, businesses can start a transaction in one channel and complete it in another. This capability is especially important for retailers that offer services such as BOPIS, where a customer orders a product online and picks it up in-store, or *ship from store*, where a customer has a product shipped to them from a store.

To ensure smooth omnichannel operations, businesses must configure the payment system for each channel, regardless of whether that channel is an online store, a retail store (also known as a brick-and-mortar store), or a call center. The Adyen payment connector ensures that the same payment methods and configurations are available across all channels, so that both customers and staff have a consistent experience.

## Adyen payment terminals and fleet management

Adyen also offers a wide range of payment terminals, from mobile point-of-sale (POS) devices to more traditional countertop terminals, all of which are fully compatible with the Dynamics 365 environment. These terminals support various payment methods and are designed to be future-proof. Automatic updates ensure that they remain compliant with the latest payment regulations and methods.

For larger businesses that have multiple locations, Adyen's Terminal Fleet Manager provides centralized control over all payment terminals. This self-service functionality simplifies everything from ordering new devices to configuring existing ones. Therefore, it helps reduce the administrative burden of managing payment hardware across multiple stores or regions.

## Conclusion

The Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen is a powerful tool for businesses that are looking for ways to streamline their payment processes across multiple channels and regions. Its integration with Dynamics 365 Commerce provides a seamless, out-of-box solution that eliminates the need for multiple external vendors, and therefore reduces costs and complexity.

Adyen supports more than 150 payment methods and provides advanced features, such as store and forward, unified commerce flows, and terminal Fleet management. In this way, it ensures that businesses can deliver a frictionless payment experience to their customers, regardless of whether they shop online, in-store, or over the phone.
