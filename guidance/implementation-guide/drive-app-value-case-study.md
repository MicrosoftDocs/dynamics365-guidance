# Business-focused digital transformation case study

Dynamics 365 helps you adjust your business processes to change. Let's look at an example of how change management is key to the success of an implementation strategy.

In 2020, one of our clients, an accounting network, faced unique and unexpected challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic had disrupted face-to-face work, threatened global supply chains, and changed regulatory and political landscapes.

To keep the business running and stay connected with customers, the company adapted its digital selling techniques with Dynamics 365. With a complete view of each profile, sales staff could work remotely without compromising the customer experience.

The solution also integrated with the firm's risk assessment tool to identify vulnerable areas caused by the pandemic, letting staff create proactive plans for their clients. The company keeps its business personal, up-to-date, and resilient by optimizing digital solutions in a time of uncertainty.

This successful pivot shows the power of Dynamics 365 as an adaptable cloud platform that can not only deliver strategic solutions but also adapt to changing business needs quickly.
