***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Guides, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

The *service to cash* process is broken down into several business process areas. The following sections further describe the business process areas.

## Establish servicing policies and procedures

Servicing policies and procedures in Dynamics 365 help your organization provide high-quality service to your customers. Start by defining your organization's service policies, including service level agreements (SLAs), response times, and escalation procedures. This definition helps make sure that your team understands the expectations for service delivery and can respond appropriately to customer requests.

Determine the channels through which customers can submit service requests, such as phone, email, or web portal. Create a process for service request handling. Define a process for how service requests will be handled. Include how they'll be assigned to resources, how progress will be tracked, and how customers will be updated on the status of their requests.

- Establish procedures for resource management.

- Develop a billing process.

- Monitor and measure service performance.

### Create and manage service resources

Service resources refer to the people, equipment, and facilities required to deliver a service. Dynamics 365 allows organizations to manage service resources and deliver high-quality customer experiences.

### Create and manage accounts for servicing

The ability to effectively create and manage accounts for servicing in Dynamics 365 is core to making sure that the right information is provided for all aspects of the *service to cash* process. Through relationships between accounts and related *service to cash* data, you also gain insights into your service operations, which can improve your overall efficiency.

## Asset management

Leasing an asset within Dynamics 365 refers to the process of creating and maintaining a lease agreement for a specific asset, such as a piece of equipment, vehicle, or property. With lease management in Dynamics 365, businesses can create leases and associated assets, manage lease terms and conditions, and track payments and invoices. 

## Create work orders

Work orders are used to track the progress of a job or task from start to finish, and can include information such as the job description, the parts and resources required, and the estimated completion time.

To create a work order in Dynamics 365, users typically start by selecting the appropriate work order type. There are several different types of work orders, including maintenance, repair, and installation orders. Once the type of work order has been selected, users can enter the necessary details, such as the customer's name, the work order description, and the priority level.

Next, users can add the necessary resources to the work order, such as labor, equipment, and materials. Dynamics 365 provides a range of tools to help users manage resources, including scheduling tools that allow users to assign resources to specific tasks and track progress in real-time.

## Schedule work orders

Dynamics 365 provides a range of tools and features to help users schedule work orders, enabling them to allocate resources effectively, ensure tasks are completed on time, and minimize downtime.

To schedule work orders, users typically start by reviewing the work order backlog and identifying any high-priority tasks. They can then use the scheduling tools to assign resources to these tasks based on their availability and skill set. Users can also be helped scheduling tasks by using automated scheduling optimization capabilities.

Users can also use Dynamics 365 to set up preventative maintenance schedules. This involves creating recurring work orders for tasks such as equipment inspections or regular maintenance tasks. 

## Perform service work

The execution of work orders within Dynamics 365 involves the actual completion of the tasks specified in the work order. This process typically involves multiple steps, including job assignment, tracking progress, updating status, and closing out the work order.

Once a work order has been scheduled and assigned to a technician or a team, the execution process begins. The technician can access the work order details, including any instructions, checklists, or documentation needed to complete the task. They can also access any necessary tools, equipment, or materials required for the job.

## Review and close work orders

Once the work order is completed, the technician can close out the job. This involves updating the work order status to reflect the completion of the task, adding any notes or comments about the job, and closing out any associated purchase orders or invoices.

## Issue customer invoices

In Dynamics 365, the issue of customer invoices is a critical process that enables businesses to bill their customers accurately and efficiently. This process involves creating invoices based on the products or services provided to the customer and recording payment information to keep track of outstanding balances.

## Analyze service operations

Dynamics 365 also provides reporting and analytics tools that can be used to analyze work order execution data, such as task completion times, resource utilization, and cost analysis. This data can be used to optimize future work orders and improve the efficiency of the maintenance or repair process.
