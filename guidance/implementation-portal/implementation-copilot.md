# Use Copilot to find guidance in the Implementation Portal

Copilot is powered by [Microsoft Copilot](/copilot/overview), a technology that understands natural language and provides relevant answers. Copilot in the [Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal](https://aka.ms/D365ImplementationPortal) helps you find documentation and guidance for your Dynamics 365 and Power Platform implementation projects.

## How to use Copilot

To launch Copilot, look for the icon in the bottom right corner of any page in the [Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal](https://aka.ms/D365ImplementationPortal).

## What you can ask Copilot

Copilot in the Implementation Portal helps you find documentation and guidance about our products. It covers all the product documentation for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform, as well as Success by Design and other implementation guidance content.

For instance, try asking Copilot, "What's new in October 2024 for sales?"

We'll add more information to help you with your projects and related tasks in future updates to the Implementation Portal.
