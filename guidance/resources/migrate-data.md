# Migrate data as part of Dynamics 365 implementation projects

***Applies to: Dynamics 365***

You can migrate the data that you want in your Dynamics 365 implementation project. Essentially, there are two types of data to think about:

- Configuration data

  Configuration data is data about different setups needed to prepare your production environment for operational use, such as currencies and tax codes.  
- Migrated data

  Migrated data is either *master data* such as customers, products, and vendors, or *open transactions* such as open sales orders, open purchase orders, stock on hand, and open balances.

Learn more about managing different types of data in Dynamics 365 at [Configuration data and data migration in Dynamics 365 implementation projects](../implementation-guide/data-management-configuration-data-migration.md).  

## Finance and operations apps

Get a general overview at [Guidelines for finance and operations apps and data management](../implementation-guide/data-management-product-specific-fo.md).  

To help you migrate relevant master data and open transactions, you can use data entities. Learn more in the following articles:

- [Import customers in Dynamics 365 projects](import-customers.md)  
- [Import products in Dynamics 365 projects](import-products.md)  
- [Import sales orders in Dynamics 365 projects](import-sales-orders.md)  
- [Import vendor invoices in Dynamics 365 projects](import-vendor-invoices.md)
