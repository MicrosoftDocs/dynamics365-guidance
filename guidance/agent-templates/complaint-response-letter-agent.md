# Agent for generating customer response letter

***Applies to***: ***Dynamics 365 Customer Service***

This agent automates the creation of customer response letters, greatly reducing the effort required to draft them. Financial services organizations generate First Response Letters (FRLs) for complaints. Automation of this process can dramatically cut the drafting time and save up to one hour per complaint. For organizations managing high complaint volumes, this capability frees significant capacity that can be redirected to resolving issues rather than administrative work.
