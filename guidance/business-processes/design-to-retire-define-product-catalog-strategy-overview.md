This article describes how to categorize, segment, and merchandise products and services by using Dynamics 365 applications.

All organizations group and categorize or segment their products into logical grouping for various reasons. Dynamics 365 includes several capabilities that you can consider implementing together at the beginning of a project.

## Stakeholders

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of theÂ *define product catalog and strategy* business process area. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

## Define product catalog and strategy process flow

The following diagram illustrates the *define product catalog and strategy* business process area. [!INCLUDE [daf-business-process-flow-def](~/../shared-content/shared/guidance-includes/daf-business-process-flow-def.md)]

1. Start

    A parallel process that isn't shown connects to an upstream business process area for *Introduce new products*. This box connects to 4.b.i. *Assign product attributes*.

1. *Design to retire* end-to-end process
1. *Define product catalog and strategy* business process area
1. *Define product policies*

    1. *Define product types*

        1. *Define product lines*
        1. *Organize products*

            A parallel branch connects to *Introduce new products*, which has parallel branches to each of the following end-to-end scenarios:

            1. *Order to cash*
            1. *Plan to produce*
            1. *Procure to pay*
            1. *Inventory to deliver*

            Each of these downstream end-to-end processes connects to *Record to report*, which connects to End.

        1. *Determine product mix for a retail channel*
        1. Is update required?

            1. Yes leads to *Maintain product catalog*.
            1. No leads to End.

    1. *Determine product attributes*

        1. *Assign product attributes*
        1. Is update required?

            1. Yes leads to *Maintain product attributes*.
            1. No leads to End.
