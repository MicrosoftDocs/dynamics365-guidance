# Checklist for performance optimization

| Done? | Task |
| :-----: | ---- |
| &check; | Agree with the cloud service provider and the implementation partner on who's responsible for delivering an acceptably performing solution. |
| &check; | Follow the service boundaries when you design, develop, and test for performance. |
| &check; | Include performance as part of the requirement conversation. Document specific goals that reflect the customer's needs and expectations. |
| &check; | Track your performance goals through future change requests. Don't let them slip away as you add new features or fix bugs. |
| &check; | Establish development, user experience, and information architecture guidelines that create a positive perception of performance. Prioritize application responsiveness and user experience over flashy graphics or complex animations. |
| &check; | Understand that user perceptions of performance are the result of many factors, such as network latency, device performance, browser add-ins, firewalls, and proxies. Test your solution in the actual user environment and location. |
| &check; | Make sure your performance testing considers realistic loads and usage scenarios. Don't rely on synthetic data or ideal conditions. |
