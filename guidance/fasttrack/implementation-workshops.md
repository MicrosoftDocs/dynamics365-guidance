- Reporting

Mandatory attendees are solution architects, functional leads, and technical leads. Recommended attendees include stakeholders from the customer and partner teams. 

## Data model design

To review the envisioned data model for the customer project. The data model reflects the functional scope and potential complexity of the project.

Agenda topics:

- Entity relationship diagram
- Out-of-the-box versus custom entities
- Entity configuration
- Option sets, custom entities, and localization
- Security, relationships, and performance
- Fields: alternate keys, calculated, and rollup
- Auditing

Mandatory attendees are solution architects, functional leads, and technical leads. Recommended attendees include stakeholders from the customer and partner teams.

Learn more at [Manage your data in Dynamics 365 implementation projects](../implementation-guide/data-management.md).

## Test strategy

Ensure the customer has planned for the various testing activities throughout the project lifecycle to ensure quality of their solution.

Agenda topics:

- Testing strategy and schedule
- Unit and functional test strategy
- System integration test strategy
- Data migration validation test strategy
- User acceptance test strategy
- Performance test strategy
- Security test strategy
- Regression test strategy
- Mock cutover test strategy
- Tools

Mandatory attendees are solution architects, functional leads, and technical leads. Recommended attendees include stakeholders from the customer and partner teams.

Learn more at [Test your Dynamics 365 solution before deployment](../implementation-guide/testing-strategy.md).

## User experience design

Identify key goals and design elements the customer is leveraging to deliver an optimal user experience.

Agenda topics:

- Ease of use – legacy system mapping
- Ease of use – simplicity/efficiency
- Aesthetics – ISV alignment
- Aesthetics – corporate branding
- Performance – speed
- Consistency of experience

Mandatory attendees are solution architects, functional leads, and technical leads. Recommended attendees include stakeholders from the customer and partner teams. 

## Application lifecycle management strategy

Understand how the partner plans to go about the process of building, testing, validating, and deploying the solutions.

Agenda topics:

- General strategy
- Build plan
- Test strategy
- Release/deploy
- Run model (post-implement enhance/maintain)
- Storage management

Mandatory attendees are solution architects, functional leads, and technical leads. Recommended attendees include stakeholders from the customer and partner teams.

Learn more at [Bring successful solutions to customers with application lifecycle management (ALM) strategies](../implementation-guide/application-lifecycle-management.md).

## Gap solution design

This workshop is meant for implementations that have critical requirements not supported by the standard system out of the box. The purpose is to spend time reviewing the top gap solutions for high-impact, high-risk extensions to provide guidance on maximizing the use of standard features, alignment to product roadmap, and general design guidance. This workshop isn't intended as a fit/gap review. The expectation is that initial consideration of solutions for every scenario will be completed prior to the workshop.

Agenda topics:

- Identify and review the main gap requirements
- Discuss proposed solution for each selected gap
- Identify and discuss any potential risks
- Brainstorm alternative solution, ISV or workaround
- Review all gaps and potential dependencies

Mandatory attendees are solution architects, functional leads, and technical leads. Recommended attendees include stakeholders from the customer and partner teams.

Learn more at [Optimize your implementation with a fit-to-standard and fit-gap analysis](../implementation-guide/process-focused-solution-fit-to-standard-fit-gap-analysis.md).

## Cutover strategy

Ensure that the cutover strategy provides a good approach and plan to deliver a well-defined, well-tested, reliable, and safe transition from current systems to the new production systems.

Agenda topics:

- Cutover vision and strategy
- Cutover project plan
- Go-live cutover plan
- Post go-live plan

Mandatory attendees are cutover lead, solution architect, data migration lead, and project manager roles. Recommended attendees include stakeholders from the customer and partner teams.

Learn more at [Transition to new solutions successfully with the cutover process](../implementation-guide/prepare-go-live-cutover-strategy.md).

## Post go-live  

Review the key accomplishments, lessons learned, and constructive feedback from the implementation following the go-live to identify adjustments to the project delivery and operations support for the next phases of the digital transformation journey with Dynamics 365.

This graduates the implementation and marks the closure of the FastTrack engagement.

Walk through the opportunities offered with the Customer Advocacy Program to join the Dynamics 365 community and share the implementation team deployment success story.

Agenda topics:

- Key accomplishments: review of goals and objectives
- Discussion of lessons learned
- Post go-live assessment
- Looking forward
- Your Microsoft account team
- Microsoft Dynamics 365 support options
- Microsoft Customer Advocacy Program

Mandatory attendees are project managers and architects. Recommended attendees include the project sponsors from the customer and partner teams.

## Business intelligence and analytics design

Agenda topics:

- Operational reporting design
- BI process requirements
- BI team structure
- Data sources and aggregation
- Data storage 
- Data model
- Portals and dashboards
- Volumes 

Mandatory attendees are solution architects, functional leads, and technical leads. Recommended attendees include stakeholders from the customer and partner teams. 

> [!Note]
> The series of implementation workshops to be executed for any program will be determined by the solution architect running the Success by Design program following the Solution Blueprint Review. The typical format is a one-to-three-hour meeting on Microsoft Teams, but duration may vary based on the level of complexity. The preceding list is not meant to be exhaustive, but a high-level description to demonstrate the principles of implementation workshops.
