# What is the Dynamics 365 implementation guide?

This section contains guidance for how to implement solutions that include Dynamics 365 apps and services. The *Success by Design* framework can help you prepare for and run even complex implementation projects. This article provides an overview of the available implementation guidance.  

## The Dynamics 365 implementation guide is online

The Dynamics 365 implementation guide is now fully available here on Microsoft Learn and integrated with other content for the Dynamics 365 apps and services. Check the [guidance hub](/dynamics365/guidance/) for new content, and use the navigation panel to find what you're looking for.

The Dynamics 365 implementation guide follows the structure of [Success by Design](success-by-design.md) with five stages:

- *Strategize*
- *Initiate*
- *Implement*
- *Prepare*
- *Operate*

The implementation guide represents the collective knowledge and experience of the FastTrack for Dynamics 365 team, gained over thousands of Dynamics 365 implementations. Here, program leaders, project managers, solution architects, system administrators, and business stakeholders on the Dynamics 365 implementation journey find expert guidance. We provide illustrative case studies, and the thinking, questions, and resources you need for a successful implementation.

> [!TIP]
> Some Dynamics 365 apps offer free trial experiences so that you can try things out. [The Dynamics 365 documentation hub](/dynamics365/) lists all Dynamics 365 apps with a link to where you can find a free trial or a guided tour.
