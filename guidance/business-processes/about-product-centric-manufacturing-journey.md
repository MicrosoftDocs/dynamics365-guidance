# Map of business processes and a product-centric manufacturing journey

This article describes what a product-centric manufacturing organization is and the end-to-end business processes these types of organizations typically manage and how Dynamics 365 can support these processes.  

In a product-centric manufacturing organization, the primary focus is on efficiently designing, producing, and delivering high-quality products that meet evolving customer demands. These organizations rely on streamlined, interconnected processes that span the entire product lifecycle—from ideation to customer support. Microsoft Dynamics 365 offers a comprehensive suite of tools that empower manufacturers to optimize these processes, enhance agility, and drive innovation.

## What is a product-centric manufacturing organization?

A product-centric manufacturing organization is structured around the creation and continuous improvement of physical goods. These companies prioritize product quality, production efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Their operations are typically aligned with a make-to-stock or make-to-order model, depending on market demands and business strategy.

## Key end-to-end processes in product-centric manufacturing

The following diagram shows a typical sequence of end-to-end processes that product-centric manufacturing organizations follow in a make-to-stock scenario.

## Adapt to make-to-order scenarios

The diagram and this article show the general sequence for a make-to-stock environment. In a make-to-order environment, the sequence shifts to align production with specific customer orders. Here, the **Prospect to quote** and **Order to cash** processes come before **Source to pay**, so organizations get materials only after confirming customer demand. Dynamics 365 supports this flexibility with configurable workflows and real-time data integration across departments.

## Key challenges in product-centric manufacturing

Product-centric manufacturing offers a structured approach to delivering high-quality goods, but it also presents operational and strategic challenges. Understanding these challenges helps organizations stay competitive and resilient in a dynamic market.

1. Volatility in demand  

    Fluctuating customer demand can lead to overproduction or stockouts, especially in make-to-stock environments. Accurate forecasting is critical but often difficult because of market unpredictability.

1. Complex supply chains  

    A supply chain quickly grows complex when you must manage global suppliers, transnational logistics, and compliance requirements. Disruptions like geopolitical events or raw material shortages can significantly affect production timelines.

1. Product lifecycle management  

    Coordinating product development, updates, and retirements across departments and geographies requires robust collaboration and version control mechanisms.

1. Operational efficiency  

    Balancing cost, quality, and speed is a constant challenge. Inefficiencies in production scheduling, resource allocation, or maintenance can lead to increased costs and reduced output.

1. Regulatory compliance  

    Manufacturers must navigate a web of industry-specific regulations, environmental standards, and safety requirements, which vary by region and product type.

1. Technology integration  

    Integrating legacy systems with modern digital tools can be difficult. A lack of real-time data visibility and siloed systems hinders decision-making and responsiveness.

1. Talent shortages  

    Skilled labor shortages, especially in areas like advanced manufacturing and automation, can limit growth and innovation.

1. Sustainability pressures  

    There is growing pressure to reduce environmental impact through sustainable sourcing, energy-efficient production, and waste reduction—often requiring significant investment.
