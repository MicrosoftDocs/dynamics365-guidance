# Overview of the Administer to operate business process areas

***Applies to: Dynamics 365***

The *administer to operate* process is broken down into many business process areas. The following sections further describe the business process areas.

## Implement solutions

This area pulls the Dynamics 365 implementation guide into the context of business processes. The Dynamics 365 implementation guide follows the structure of Success by Design with five stages:

- Strategize
- Initiate
- Implement
- Prepare
- Operate

## Define business continuity plan

Crafting a robust business continuity plan ensures that organizations can weather disruptions effectively, safeguarding critical operations and data integrity in the face of unforeseen events. The process of defining a business continuity plan (BCP) under *administer to operate* involves establishing a comprehensive strategy to ensure the organization's resilience in the face of disruptions. Dynamics 365 facilitates this process by providing tools for data backup, disaster recovery, and failover mechanisms. Through features like Azure Site Recovery and Azure Backup, organizations can define and implement robust BCPs, ensuring the continuity of critical operations during unforeseen events.

## Manage licensing and entitlements

The meticulous management of licensing and entitlements is central to optimizing resource allocation, ensuring that the organization's Dynamics 365 investment aligns seamlessly with user needs and business requirements. Efficiently managing licensing and entitlements is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and ensuring compliance. Dynamics 365 offers License Management tools that allow organizations to oversee user licenses, track entitlements, and align them with business needs. This process ensures that the organization's investment in Dynamics 365 aligns with user requirements while maintaining compliance with licensing agreements.  

## Administer system features

System features are the backbone of Dynamics 365 functionality. Administering these features involves tasks such as the following list:

- Fine-tuning configurations  
- Applying optimal alignment with evolving business processes  
- Staying up to date with Microsoft release notes and configuring new features from the feature management workspace.  

This business process area helps make sure that Dynamics 365 is optimized for your business needs. With Power Apps and Dynamics 365 customization features, administrators can tailor the system to the organization's specific requirements. This process helps make sure that Dynamics 365 remains a tailored and dynamic solution, adapting seamlessly to evolving business processes.  

## Manage system access and security

Central to the *administer to operate* framework is the careful management of system access and security. This area encompasses the establishment and enforcement of robust user roles, permissions, and security protocols. The process of managing system access and security is critical for safeguarding sensitive data within Dynamics 365. Role-based access control, Microsoft Entra ID, and multifactor authentication (MFA) are integral features that Dynamics 365 provides for securing solutions. A regular user security review that includes Lifecycle Service and the Power Platform admin center helps make sure that the proper access is maintained. This process ensures that only authorized individuals have access to specific functionalities, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of organizational data.

## Train users and increase adoption

Driving user adoption is a key aspect of ongoing success. *Administer to operate* includes efforts to train users effectively, enhancing their proficiency with Dynamics 365 and promoting widespread adoption. The area of training users and increasing adoption is a key focus in *administer to operate* and emphasizes the importance of user proficiency and widespread platform adoption. Dynamics 365 Human Resources has capabilities to help facilitate user training and onboarding. These processes help ensure that users are equipped with the skills needed to maximize their productivity within Dynamics 365, ultimately driving increased adoption across the organization.

## Monitor systems, environments, and capacity

Continuous monitoring of system performance, environments, and capacity is imperative. *Administer to operate* focuses on proactive measures to identify and address potential bottlenecks, ensuring optimal system performance. This business process area is essential for proactive issue identification and optimal performance. Dynamics 365 provides monitoring and diagnostic tools such as Azure Monitor and Application Insights. This process ensures that administrators can track system performance, identify potential bottlenecks, and optimize capacity to deliver a seamless user experience.  

## Manage background jobs

Efficient management of background jobs contributes to streamlined operations. This business process area involves overseeing and optimizing background processes to maintain system efficiency. With Power Automate flows and batch jobs in Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps and Business Central solutions, administrators can automate and manage these background tasks. This process contributes to streamlined operations and improved system efficiency.  

## Manage notifications and alerts

Timely awareness of system events is crucial. This business process area includes the management of notifications and alerts to keep stakeholders informed and responsive to critical updates. Dynamics 365 provides features like Power Automate and Power Apps to configure and manage notifications based on predefined triggers. Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps also include an in-app alert feature that can be easily integrated with Power Automate. These processes ensure that administrators are promptly alerted to potential issues, enabling proactive responses and issue resolution.  

## Uptake software releases

Staying current with software releases is essential for using new features and improvements. *Administer to operate* facilitates the smooth uptake of software releases, ensuring organizations benefit from the latest advancements.  

The *Uptaking software releases* business process area involves seamlessly adopting new features and improvements within Dynamics 365. The platform's continuous updates and releases provide organizations with the latest advancements. Dynamics 365 provides a dedicated Power Platform environment for testing and validating these releases before deployment, ensuring a smooth uptake without disrupting ongoing operations.  

## Manage data

Effective data synchronization is vital for maintaining consistency across the Dynamics 365 ecosystem. Manage data synchronization involves managing data synchronization processes to uphold data integrity. Dynamics 365's data integration features include features such as Dual Write and Virtual Entities. Developers can use the Power Platform's data connectors and Azure services to synchronize data seamlessly between different systems and applications. This process ensures that data across the organization remains accurate, up-to-date, and aligned with business processes.

## Manage system compliance

Ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and internal policies is paramount in any technology implementation. Managing system compliance includes processes to manage system compliance, safeguarding organizations against risks. The platform provides features like Compliance Manager and Azure Policy integration to assist organizations in monitoring and enforcing compliance. Additionally, Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps include the Audit workbench module and built-in audit logs for Dynamics 365 Finance. When you implement these processes carefully, they help safeguard against risks and ensure that the organization operates within legal and regulatory frameworks.  

## Support systems

*Administer to operate* extends beyond proactive measures to encompass responsive support. This area involves addressing user queries, troubleshooting issues, and providing ongoing assistance to maintain a resilient Dynamics 365 environment.  

*Support systems* is an integral aspect of administering to operating any technology solution. The process involves responsive assistance for users and efficient issue resolution. Dynamics 365 offers tools such as Copilot Studio where you can build intelligent copilots, and the Dynamics 365 Support Hub for comprehensive support resources. This process ensures that users receive timely assistance, queries are addressed efficiently, and issues are resolved promptly, contributing to a resilient Dynamics 365 environment that functions smoothly.
