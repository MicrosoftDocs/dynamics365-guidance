# What is a good profile in the Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal?

In this article, we describe the characteristics of a good profile and how to profile your project well.

## Profile details

A good profile in the Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal is important because it helps both you and Microsoft make the proper context available for guidance and proactive support. Project details, such as the complete list of business processes, the products that are included, and the features for each of them, play a vital role in the profile details. Implementation guidance is tailored to your project based on information in the profile. You can update the project profile on the *Project Profile* tab.  

A good profile in the Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal is important because it helps both you and Microsoft make the proper context available for guidance and proactive support.

Implementation guidance is tailored to your project based on information in the profile. You can update the project profile on the *Project Profile* tab.  

A good profile should also specify the products, features, growth characteristics, and the business processes that are in scope of the implementation project. We suggest that you add the profiling when you create the project, and that you keep the profile updated as the project scope and detail changes through the implementation. It's a best practice to review and update the profile at regular intervals to match the reality of the project.

We suggest that you add the profiling when you create the project, and that you keep the profile updated as the project scope and detail changes through the implementation. It's a best practice to review and update the profile at regular intervals to match the reality of the project.  

Here are some examples of what to include in a good profile:

- **Products**: All the products in scope for the implementation project.  
- **Processes**: The end-to-end business processes and business process areas from the [business process catalog](../business-processes/about.md) that are planned in the project.  
- **Features**: Features that are being implemented for the products in the project.  
- **Complexity**: The number of customizations required, the level of integration with other systems, and the level of data migration required.  
- **Growth**: The expected growth rate of the system, the expected number of users, and the expected number of locations.  
- **Other characteristics**: As detailed as feasible. Any information allows the portal to tailor specific proactive information relevant to the project.  

On the other hand, a bad profile is one that is incomplete or lacks detail. For example, a profile that only specifies the products wouldn't be helpful in tailoring implementation guidance to the project. In another example, a profile that doesn't include the business processes in scope is unlikely to follow a process-focused approach.

If you're a partner in the Partner Portfolio Model, good project profiling across projects lifts the portfolio score.

## How to profile

Here are the step-by-step instructions for profiling a project in the Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal:

1. Sign in to the Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal using your work account or personal Microsoft account.

2. In the left side panel, select **Projects**.

3. Select the project you want to manage.

4. The **Project Profile** tab gives you an overview of all the details of the project. You can switch between read-only and editable views of the **Project Profile** tab.

5. Use the project profile to specify the products and features in the implementation project. Implementation guidance is tailored to your project based on information in the profile.  

6. When you select a product, the page shows the product's features.

7. In the right hand column, select the *End-to-end processes*, and expand each process that is in scope to select the *business process areas* that are in scope for your project.  

8. Select **Done** to save your changes. A notification at the top of the page tells you that implementation guidance is based on the changes you made. When you get the message **Guidance is generated successfully**, select the **Implementation guidance** tab to view refreshed recommendations.
