# Map of business processes and requests from customers in implementation projects with Dynamics 365

As an implementation partner, you notice that prospective customers often ask for the same things. They want solutions for specific questions, needs, or concerns with their current business solution. You might already map these requests to features in the Dynamics apps you support. But you want a clear way to connect these requests to the business process catalog that helps you drive successful implementations. This article explains how to do that.

## Aligning AI priorities with business goals

As organizations explore the potential of artificial intelligence (AI), Microsoft Copilot, and agent-based capabilities, it's important to resist the urge to implement these technologies in isolation. While these tools offer powerful enhancements, true value and a return on investment (ROI) come from aligning AI use with clearly defined business challenges and goals. Start with the problem you want to solve, like improving operational efficiency, enhancing customer engagement, or accelerating decision-making processes. By grounding AI initiatives in business outcomes, organizations ensure these technologies aren't just innovative, but also impactful and sustainable.
