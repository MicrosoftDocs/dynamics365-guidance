# TechTalk: Solution blueprint review with FastTrack for Dynamics 365

The FastTrack for Dynamics 365 program offers organizations a structured approach to successful project implementations through the *solution blueprint review*. This crucial process, part of the broader *Success by Design* methodology, ensures that the project's scope, solution concepts, and initial designs are aligned from the outset. This article covers the importance, execution, and value of the solution blueprint review. The article and the TechTalk emphasize how the solution blueprint review helps risk detection, project clarity, and overall alignment between partners and customers.  

We based this article on [a TechTalk](https://youtu.be/LXgG_dw4NcE) that you can find online in the Dynamics 365 channel on YouTube.

## The purpose of a solution blueprint review

The solution blueprint review is designed to validate the overarching scope and design concepts of a Dynamics 365 implementation. At its core, the review serves as a workshop where the organization and their partner make sure that all parties understand the solution's foundational concepts. It's not about diving into the finer technical details but instead focusing on high-level concepts to guarantee that the design is sound and risks are identified early on.

Prepare for the workshop by gathering the details of the implementation project, such as the following information:

- Strategy documents

  - Application lifecycle management (ALM) strategy  
  - Structure for business units and legal entities
  - Environment strategy
  - Data strategy (data entities and migration scope)  
  - Integration strategy (interfaces)  
  - Production instance strategy  
  - Security strategy
  - Test plan or strategy
  - Deployment locations
  - Analytical data aggregation (scope)

- Project management artifacts

  - Project charter
  - Process catalog
  - Application diagram
  - Project plan and schedule
  - Process block diagram
  - Responsibility matrix
  - Key gaps
  - System usage profiles

When you have this review at the very beginning of the implementation process, you gain communication between the implementation team and the customer organization. This communication sets the stage for deeper discussions on what's being built and how to achieve that goal. The purpose is to uncover misalignments or forgotten components early enough to mitigate potential issues down the line.

The review ensures all stakeholders are on the same page regarding the project's scope, from high-level functional needs to broad technical approaches. This creates a baseline for the rest of the project's implementation, enabling teams to plan deeper dives and workshops on specific areas as needed.

## Detect risks early in the project lifecycle

One of the most significant advantages of the solution blueprint review is its ability to highlight risks and issues early. As part of Microsoft's *Success by Design* methodology, the emphasis is on risk prevention. If the implementation team addresses possible challenges in the initial stages of the project, they can avoid costly disruptions later.

The review allows for the identification of risks related to the scope, timelines, and other critical aspects of the project. For example, if the project's solution concepts are misaligned with the customer's goals, or if there are gaps in the plan. The review can flag these issues and address them before they become larger problems. Microsoft FastTrack resources work closely with the implementation team to resolve these risks and ensure project stability moving forward.

## The process of a solution blueprint review

The process begins with the implementation team providing key inputs and materials about the project. These inputs are reviewed by the FastTrack team to establish an understanding of the scope and design of the solution.

Once the input materials are reviewed, a workshop is conducted to gather more insights and observations. During this phase, the review team collects detailed findings and categorizes them into risks, issues, or key assertions. Recommendations are then provided to address any identified risks.

This workshop can take anywhere from a couple of hours for simpler projects to up to eight hours for more complex implementations. For example, a complex solution can involve multiple applications such as Dynamics 365 Finance or Supply Chain Management. The aim is to strike a balance between reviewing broad solution concepts and digging into sufficient detail to identify potential issues, without solving every specific problem during the session.

Following the workshop, the findings are processed and reviewed with the implementation team. Final findings are then documented and shared with all key stakeholders, ensuring transparency and clarity as the project progresses.

## Address common objections

Sometimes, implementation teams or customers might push back on conducting a solution blueprint review upfront. They might argue that the project isn't ready, or that the blueprint should wait until after the analysis and design phases. However, these objections often indicate a lack of clarity in the project's foundation. If a project doesn't have a solid blueprint at the outset, it's already at risk.

Waiting until later stages to define the blueprint isn't advisable, as it postpones the identification of critical risks. A project with an undefined or "loose" scope should be examined closely to ensure that everyone understands the variables and is aligned on how to stabilize the project's foundation before moving forward.

### Plan and conduct the review

Preparation is key when you conduct a solution blueprint review. Gather as many relevant details as possible, including the project scope, key goals, and artifacts. That way, you're almost guaranteed a comprehensive review. Although not all materials may be fully developed in the early stages, having a basic scope and general implementation approach is essential.

The solution blueprint review workshop can take an hour or a day. It depends on many factors, including the Dynamics 365 apps and capabilities that are included in the project, and the external systems that the solution must connect to.  

Other factors include the following questions:

- How much is known up front?
- How early in the project is the workshop?
- How complex is the implementation?
- How standard is the approach?

On FastTrack engagements for customers that invest $100K - $300K, the Microsoft FastTrack team doesn't attend this workshop. Instead, FastTrack spends approximately 45 minutes reviewing the outcomes of the workshop.

Once the review workshop is scheduled, it's important to manage time effectively, especially for larger, more complex solutions. In most cases, the workshop is conducted remotely, split into multiple sessions over a week or two to accommodate the team's availability and to maintain focus on specific aspects of the solution.

Participation in the review should include the core members of the implementation team, such as project managers and solution architects from both the customer and partner sides. Having the right attendees ensures effective communication and understanding of the project's complexity and structure.

## Post-review process and follow-up

After the solution blueprint review workshop is completed, findings are categorized and structured for easy understanding. These findings, whether classified as risks, issues, or assertions, are shared with the project team along with actionable recommendations.

In cases where the project is within the $100,000 to $300,000 band, the partner architect typically drives the solution blueprint review, while Microsoft FastTrack architects spend time reviewing the outcomes and suggesting improvements. For larger projects, FastTrack architects take a more hands-on role in producing findings and recommendations.

Once findings are finalized, they're shared not only with the implementation team but also with key project stakeholders. This ensures that everyone involved in the project understands its health, risks, and next steps moving forward.

## Conclusion

The solution blueprint review is an essential component of the FastTrack for Dynamics 365 program. By ensuring that all parties have a clear understanding of the project's scope and design from the outset, this process mitigates risks and sets the foundation for a successful implementation. Addressing potential issues early in the project lifecycle helps prevent disruptions and keeps the project on track.
