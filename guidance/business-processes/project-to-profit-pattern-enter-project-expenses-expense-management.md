# Pattern for entering project expenses using the Dynamics 365 expense management module in Dynamics 365 Project Operations and Finance

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Project Operations***

This article explains how to enter project expenses using the Dynamics 365 expense management module, so you optimize financial oversight, detect cost overruns early, and improve project outcomes. It's a pattern under the *Track project expenses* business process in the [Manage project delivery](project-to-profit-deliver-project-work.md) area of the [Project to profit](project-to-profit-overview.md) end-to-end scenario.

## Context and problem

Efficient expense management helps maintain financial health and operational efficiency across different business functions. Integrating expense management across Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Project Operations streamlines entering, tracking, and reconciling expenses. This integration records all expense data accurately and makes it easy to access, so you get real-time insights into spending patterns and project costs. These tools help you make informed financial decisions, find cost-saving opportunities, and manage budgets more effectively. Seamless integration with Dynamics 365 Finance and Project Operations improves data accuracy and reduces errors from manual entry, so you stay compliant with internal policies and external regulations. Employees submit expenses on mobile devices, which boosts productivity and reduces administrative work. Using expense management in these Dynamics 365 apps helps you optimize expense processes for greater financial control, better project management, and improved operational efficiency.

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern for the following tasks:

1. Track expenses that are directly related to specific projects, so you accurately allocate expenses and ensure all costs are captured for analysis, like budgeting and financial reporting. This pattern improves project costing and billing accuracy.
1. Control costs and improve efficiency by automating and streamlining the process from submission to reimbursement.
1. Integrate seamlessly with other Dynamics 365 modules, like Project Management and Accounting, Finance, and Human resources. Integration improves efficiency by providing a unified view of financial data and project information.
1. Ensure strict adherence to expense policies, like limits on travel or per diem rates. The system automatically enforces policies and flags out-of-policy expenses.
1. Use the mobile app to submit expenses on the go, capture receipts, submit reports, and track reimbursement status.
1. Customize approval workflows based on your organization's policies, so expense reports are routed according to those policies.
1. Use robust reporting and analytics to gain insights into spending patterns, identify cost-saving opportunities, and track key performance metrics.

This pattern might not be suitable:

- When there's a large number of complex intercompany transactions where expenses must be allocated across multiple legal entities. In such cases, it might be more efficient to use specialized financial management tools or processes.
- When there are limitations in the system due to which the expense categories required for a project aren't available or can't be created. In that case, it might be necessary to use alternative methods for tracking costs on the projects.
- When you don't need the full functionalities of expense management (enforcement of the organization's policies, approval workflows, detailed reporting). If you need only basic expense tracking, it might be easier to do the processes manually or use simpler tools.
- When you have a large number of small and frequent expenses. In that case, the administrative overhead of entering each expense into the system can outweigh the benefits. You can increase efficiency by using a more streamlined or bulk entry method.
- When expenses aren't directly related to a specific project, enter them using general expense management processes instead of linking them to a specific project.

## Solution: Expense management integration

This solution provides a foundational framework for tracking and managing expenses across both Dynamics 365 Finance and Project Operations. By using the built-in expense management tools, businesses can ensure accurate recording of expenses, enforce compliance with company policies, and integrate expenses seamlessly with financial and project-related workflows. For organizations that use Project Operations, this integration allows expenses to be linked directly to specific projects. This way, you get precise tracking of billable and non-billable costs, improved budget management, and increased likelihood that project profitability is maintained.

### Procedure: Enter expenses in the built-in expense management tools

Use the following steps to enter expenses:

1. Enable the **Expense Management** module

    Activate the **Expense Management** module in Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Project Operations. Learn more at [Lifecycle Services resources](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs).  

1. Configure expense categories and policies

    Set up expense categories and define policies for expense submission and approval. [Learn more about configuring expense categories](/dynamics365/project-operations/expense/set-up-expense-categories).

1. Automate approval workflows

    Configure automated workflows for expense approvals to streamline the process. [Learn more about setting up workflows](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/create-workflow).

## Issues and considerations

Consider the following points when you're deciding how to implement this pattern:

- **Integration and Data Flow** - Ensure seamless integration between Expense Management, Dynamics 365 Finance, and Project Operations to maintain accurate and real-time data flow.
- **Expense Categories and Policies** - Define and configure expense categories that align with project and financial reporting needs. Establish clear expense policies to ensure compliance and streamline the approval process.
- **Automated Workflows** - Implement automated approval workflows to reduce manual intervention and speed up the expense reporting process.
- **Credit Card Integration** - Integrate corporate credit card transactions to simplify the expense reporting process for employees. Ensure that credit card expenses are automatically categorized and reconciled.
- **Cost Allocation** - Enable functionality to allocate shared expenses across multiple projects, ensuring equitable distribution of costs.
- **Reporting Requirements** - Set up reporting tools to provide visibility into project expenses, budget utilization, and variance analysis for informed decision-making.
- **Currency and Tax Handling** - Account for multi-currency and tax requirements if projects involve international teams or cross-border activities.
