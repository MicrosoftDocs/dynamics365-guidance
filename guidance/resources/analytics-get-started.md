# Get started with analytics for digital call centers

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Contact Center, Dynamics 365 Customer Service***

This article describes how to start to use analytics with call centers that are based on Dynamics 365. It highlights the need to create a company-wide reporting plan and do a fit-gap analysis before implementation is started.

## Build your reporting strategy

The first step is to define a reporting strategy. You must identify the business objectives and goals that the call center is expected to achieve. These objectives and goals are usually beyond the call center and the customer service departments. Instead, they are defined by organizational stakeholders, such as the management, sales, and marketing teams. In this way, a company-wide vision drives the call center reporting strategy.

After you've identified the objectives and goals, the next step is to determine the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure the call center's success. These KPIs might include metrics such as average handle time, first-call resolution, customer satisfaction, and agent productivity. 

Next, it's essential to determine how you track those metrics and regularly report on them. Dynamics 365 Customer Service includes capabilities for both [historical analytics](/dynamics365/customer-service/configure-cs-historical-analytics-csh) and [real-time analytics](/dynamics365/customer-service/enable-realtime-analytics-dashboard-administrator?branch=main). These built-in capabilities should be a good starting point for most organizations. Explore the reports, and identify gaps early to determine the tools and skill set that you need to expand the built-in reports.

Finally, ensure that the reporting strategy is aligned with overall business objectives. Make sure that the generated reports are actionable and provide insights that the organization can use to improve the call center's performance. 

## Sample reporting strategy goals

Here are some examples that can help you measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the call center operations.

- **Service level agreement (SLA) compliance**: Set a goal to have a specific percentage of calls answered within a specific timeframe. Monitor and report on SLA compliance to ensure prompt and efficient customer service.
- **First-call resolution (FCR) rate**: Aim to resolve customer issues during the first interaction. Measure the percentage of calls or cases that are successfully resolved without the need for further follow-up. A higher FCR rate indicates efficient problem-solving and customer satisfaction.
- **Average handle time (AHT)**: Set a target for the average duration of each customer interaction, including talk time and after-call work. Monitoring of AHT helps identify areas where more agent training or process improvements might be needed to reduce call durations.
- **Customer satisfaction (CSAT) score**: Implement customer satisfaction surveys or post-call feedback mechanisms to measure customer happiness with the service that is provided. Maintain a goal to achieve a specific CSAT score, and regularly track it to ensure continuous improvement.
- **Agent performance metrics**: Evaluate individual agent performance based on metrics such as call volume, average handle time, customer feedback, and adherence to scripts or guidelines. Identify top performers and areas where more coaching or training is needed.
- **Call abandonment rate**: Track the percentage of calls that are abandoned by customers before they reach an agent. High abandonment rates might indicate long wait times or inadequate staffing levels that require adjustments to optimize service levels.
- **Call quality monitoring**: Implement a system to monitor and score call quality based on predefined criteria. Regularly review and report on call quality scores to ensure consistent adherence to service standards and identify areas for improvement.
- **Self-service adoption**: If self-service options are available, track the adoption rate, and measure the percentage of customer interactions that are successfully resolved through self-service channels. Promote self-service tools to reduce call volume and improve efficiency.
- **Agent occupancy rate**: Monitor the percentage of time that agents spend on active calls or handling customer interactions. A higher occupancy rate indicates better utilization of agent time and resources.
- **Cost per call**: Measure the cost that is incurred for each customer interaction, including agent salaries, technology expenses, and operational overheads. Aim to optimize costs while you also maintain or improve service quality.

> [!NOTE]
> These examples are just starting points. The specific reporting strategy and goals should be aligned with the organization's objectives, customer expectations, and the capabilities of your implementation of Digital Contact Center Platform. We recommend that you regularly review and refine the reporting strategy based on feedback and insights that you gain from the implemented call center solution.

## Fit-gap analysis for out-of-box reports and dashboards

Do a detailed fit-gap analysis at an early stage of the implementation. Omnichannel for Dynamics 365 Customer Service provides a wide range of information through out-of-box capabilities. However, the fit-gap analysis is essential. It helps identify major gaps in reporting capabilities at the beginning of the project. In this way, the project team can explore alternative solutions, such as workarounds or extension of out-of-box features through customization.

By identifying the reporting gaps during the early stages, the team can better plan and list all the capabilities and costs that are needed to achieve the organization's analytics goals. By proactively addressing these gaps, you can ensure a smoother implementation and customization process.
