# Success by Design with the Dynamics 365 business process catalog in Mavim

This article introduces how to use Microsoft's business process catalog following the Success by Design framework in the platform by Mavim, an external software company. Find the Mavim solution in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/mavimbv1671629332610.mavim_bpm?tab=Overview).

This article focuses on the Strategize phase in Success by Design of a Dynamics 365 implementation. Learn more from [an Introduction to the Success by Design Framework](/dynamics365/guidance/implementation-guide/success-by-design).

The business process catalog in Mavim, a best-practice operational framework, provides a structured approach to defining business goals and a comprehensive implementation strategy by outlining optimal 'to-be' processes based on Microsoft's extensive experience.

This article explores how the prebuilt content of the business process catalog within Mavim accelerates and enhances the diagnostic activities of the Strategize phase, enabling a shared understanding and a durable foundation for a successful 'first-time right' implementation.

## Build a strategy

It's important to start your implementation plan by developing a strategy that's right for your organization. To develop a strategy, you must understand the goals of the investment and its outcome for your organization, how your business currently runs, how your business wants to work, and the requirements for the project to develop that approach. An efficient, honest implementation strategy can only be fully achieved by using a best practice operational framework (content) and a process management software (tooling) together.

Processes fit into determining business goals and a full strategy for the implementation because they provide a structured approach to achieving those goals. Business goals represent the desired future state of an organization—what it wants to achieve. Implementation refers to the actions and projects undertaken to reach those goals. Processes act as "the how"—the structured series of activities and workflows that are executed to achieve "the what" (the goals).

## Business process catalog

A business process is defined as a series of structured activities and tasks used by organizations to achieve specific goals and objectives; it's the way your people work.

The business process catalog provides a framework that outlines the optimal processes for following recommended practices when working with a business solution. It's based on research by the Dynamics 365 FastTrack team and their experience, and feedback from the Dynamics 365 community. Learn more at [What is the catalog?](about.md#what-is-the-catalog).

### What does this mean for building an implementation strategy

The business process catalog offers a series of templated 'to-be' processes for strategy building and operational aligning for the project, therefore accelerating and enabling the Strategize phase to be more accurate.

Having a process framework that creates a shared understanding between the customer stakeholders and the partners helping to implement during the Strategize phase is crucial. An effective strategy build only happens through looking at your processes and ensuring they align with business drivers and project goals. This involves identifying all the 'to-be' business processes based on the goals, and best practices, and assigning responsibility for each end-to-end process within the organization. This enables the partner and customer to start speaking the same language for the implementation, and to build a ground to start on.

## Business process management with Mavim

Business process modeling is a long-term discipline focused on describing, modeling, creating, and managing processes. It's essential for working with large sets of processes and data like the business process catalog because it takes large amounts of information from Excel and other apps and displays it in a way that's easily consumable and collaborative to all types of users within the customer, and partners involved.

The Mavim platform allows all users to visualize and manage processes in one space, one hierarchy. It supports process modeling, metadata documentation, collaboration, process mining, and integrations, such as synchronizing processes with Azure DevOps. The Mavim platform visualizes processes in a diagram format, making it easy to understand the flow and responsibilities within a process. Users can easily drill down into specific areas and processes.

In the Strategize phase of Success by Design, the business process catalog in Mavim plays a prominent role in drilling down from top to bottom, to provide a format to easily understanding of all business processes, process structures and areas, and scenarios connected and in order, making it easy to benchmark to project goals, drivers, and requirements for the project.

## Conclusion

Understanding and navigating the business process catalog in Mavim, as outlined in this article, is the crucial first step towards a well-defined and successful Dynamics 365 implementation strategy. By establishing this shared foundation of best-practice processes, organizations can significantly reduce ambiguity and accelerate the journey towards their desired business outcomes. In upcoming articles, we continue to explore how to use this powerful combination throughout the remaining phases of the Success by Design framework.
