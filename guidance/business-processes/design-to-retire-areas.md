# Overview of the design to retire process areas bring services to market and introduce new products

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Insights, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

The *design to retire* process is broken down into business process areas for categorizing products, introducing new products, maintaining product data, organizing and assigning product attributes and catalogs, designing and configuring manufactured products, controlling product engineering changes, defining product costing, managing product pricing, managing product assortments and catalogs, and managing product lifecycle, respectively. The following sections further describe the business process areas.

The *design to retire* process covers the process for introducing new tangible products. Learn more about bringing services to market at [Concept to market](concept-to-market-overview.md).

## Define product catalog and strategy

This business process area involves categorizing products based on various attributes such as product type, product line, service type, brand, and so on. The exact categories in your organization will vary based on the complexity of the products you offer and the industry and types of products you offer. Categorization helps in organizing products and making it easier for customers to find what they are looking for. Internally, categorization helps you report and analyze trends on your products. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management and Commerce support the creation of category hierarchies to further enhance the discoverability of your products. Learn more at [Define product catalog and strategy overview](design-to-retire-define-product-catalog-strategy-overview.md).

In addition, defining and managing product assortments and catalogs is included in this business process area. Which involves the determination of which products to offer, creating and maintaining catalogs, and managing inventory levels. Effective management of product assortments and catalogs can help organizations optimize sales and minimize costs. <!-- Learn more at TODOADDLINK[Manage product assortments and catalog\].-->

Finally, this business process area involves organizing and assigning product attributes such as color, size, style, and configuration, to products. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management also supports unlimited custom-defined attributes that can be used to report, analyze, and display in the point of sale or website when you use it together with Dynamics 365 Commerce. Additionally, you can create catalogs to group related products together. Organizing products in this way can help customers find products more easily and make it easier for organizations to manage and analyze their product data. <!-- Learn more at TODOADDLINK[Organize and assign product attributes and catalogs\]. -->

## Introduce new products

Every organization has a process to develop and introduce new products to the market. The process includes idea generation, concept development, product design, testing, and launch. Office 365 includes a variety of tools to help you keep organized, and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes tools to help with the business process flow of introducing new products including a configurable workflow. For more basic products, you can also design a business process flow in Dynamics 365 Sales. When you are ready to test new products and advertise new products, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights includes a variety of tools to help you with the process. A well-managed introduction of new products can help organizations stay competitive and meet customer needs.

Organizations that design or manufacture products have additional processes that are supported by Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to assist with the design and configuration of manufactured products, including creating product designs, bills of materials (BOMs) or formulas, and routing information (manufacturing steps). We also support simpler scenarios where kits or bundles are assembled either in a store or warehouse, for example. Efficient product design and configuration can help organizations reduce costs and improve product quality.

This business process area involves controlling changes made to product designs and configurations, ensuring that changes are properly documented, approved, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes a robust **Engineering change management** module to help organizations manage product changes. Effective change control can help organizations minimize the risk of product defects and improve product quality.

## Define product costing

All organizations need to analyze and define the costs associated with manufacturing and delivering products, including direct material costs, direct labor costs, and overhead costs. Dynamics 365 Sales includes the ability to assign basic costs to products, while Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes more robust costing capabilities including, but not limited to multiple costing methodologies such as LIFO, FIFO, standard, and average costing, cost calculations and roll-ups for manufactured or purchased products, including indirect cost calculations for overheads. Understanding product costs is essential for setting prices and making informed business decisions. Learn more at [Define product costing overview](design-to-retire-define-product-costing-overview.md).

## Manage product pricing

Once you have defined costs, you can start to manage and define product prices based on various factors such as cost, competition, and customer demand. Effective pricing strategies can help organizations improve profitability and maintain a competitive advantage. Dynamics 365 Sales includes basic sales pricing functionality, while Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management has a pricing engine that includes trade agreements, price lists, customer loyalty programs, promotions, and discounts to help determine the best price. <!-- Learn more at TODOADDLINK[Manage product pricing\].-->

## Manage product lifecycle

This business process area involves managing the entire lifecycle of a product, from ideation to retirement. Managing the product lifecycle involves making strategic decisions about product development, pricing, and marketing to ensure that the product remains profitable and relevant to the market. <!-- Learn more at TODOADDLINK[Manage product lifecycle\].-->
