# Implement solutions overview

***Applies to: Dynamics 365***

This article represents entry no. *99.01 Implement solutions* in the business process catalog that pulls [the Dynamics 365 implementation guide](../implementation-guide/overview.md) into the context of business processes.  

## Mapping tasks to the implementation guide

The Dynamics 365 implementation guide follows the structure of [Success by Design](../implementation-guide/success-by-design.md) with five stages:

- *Strategize*
- *Initiate*
- *Implement*
- *Prepare*
- *Operate*

The *Implement solutions* business process area is part of the *implement* stage. But it covers tasks across all five stages. The following table provides links to the different sections of the implementation guide and other articles in the Dynamics 365 guidance hub.
