# AgentScript and Macro samples  

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Customer Service***

Agent scripts play a pivotal role in reducing the risk of human errors throughout the resolution process. They serve as guiding frameworks, directing agents on the necessary actions to take during customer interactions. This alignment with established business processes empowers agents to deliver swift, standardized resolutions, which reduces average handling time and elevating customer satisfaction.

The different types of agent scripts include text-based guidance and macros. Macros automate repetitive tasks by reducing complex actions to a single action. By integrating these elements, teams can streamline workflows and enhance overall operational efficiency.
