# Procure to pay business process areas

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Microsoft Supply Chain Center***

The *procure to pay* process is broken down into multiple business process areas. The following sections further describe the business process areas.

## Manage vendor relationships

This business process area involves managing vendor relationships by identifying and selecting qualified vendors, negotiating contracts. It also covers monitoring vendor performance, and maintaining a positive relationship with vendors. There are processes for creating vendor records either manually or through the application process for a vendor through an external vendor collaboration portal. <!-- Learn more at TODO: ADD LINK Manage vendor relationships -->

## Develop sourcing strategies

This business process area involves developing sourcing strategies by analyzing spend data, identifying cost-saving opportunities, selecting the appropriate sourcing method, and negotiating contracts with suppliers. In Dynamics 365, you can also configure for products to determine the sourcing method for supply forecasting and master planning, as well as set pricing within trade agreements and purchase agreements. <!-- Learn more at TODO: ADD LINK Develop sourcing strategies -->

## Define procurement catalogs

This business process area covers the definition of procurement catalogs by creating a standardized list of goods and services that can be purchased. It also covers the setup of pricing and availability information, and keeping the catalog accurate. In Dynamics 365, this process includes not only internal catalogs and categorization of products for procurement, but also external catalogs for punchout. Learn more at [Define procurement catalogs overview](procure-to-pay-define-procurement-catalogs-overview.md).  

## Define policies and procedures for procurement

This business process area involves establishing guidelines for purchasing, defining the roles and responsibilities of procurement staff, and ensuring compliance with regulations and internal policies. Dynamics 365 includes features for managing signing limits, approval hierarchies, and workflow configuration to define the approval process along with procurement policies for rules such as when a purchase requisition is required, when a request for quotation is required, and when a purchase is considered capitalized with integration for fixed assets, as a few examples. <!-- Learn more at TODO: ADD LINK Define policies and procedures for procurement -->

## Procure materials and services

This business process area involves creating purchase requisitions, request quotations, purchase orders, and purchase agreements. It also includes communications with vendors about the purchases either manually or electronically including EDI (Electronic Data Interchange), or by using a portal such as the one you use for onboarding vendors in [the **Vendor Collaboration** module](/dynamics365/supply-chain/procurement/set-up-maintain-vendor-collaboration). The purchase orders can also come from other business process areas such as [Project to profit](project-to-profit-introduction.md) or [Plan to produce](plan-to-produce-introduction.md).

## Process vendor invoices

This business process area involves processing vendor invoices by verifying invoice accuracy, matching invoices to purchase orders and goods receipts, and performing two-way or three-way matching. The invoices can be received and processed manually, using automation, or EDI, for example. The **Invoice register journal** in Dynamics 365 Finance provides quick entry to accrue the expense.  <!-- Learn more at TODO: ADD LINK Process vendor invoices -->

## Issue and settle vendor payments

This business process area involves paying vendors according to the agreed-upon payment terms and ensuring that payments are made accurately and on time. In Dynamics 365 Finance, you can use [vendor payment proposals](/dynamics365/finance/accounts-payable/automate-vendor-payment-proposal) to settle invoices manually or with an automated process. Dynamics 365 supports various payment formats, including, but not limited to, checks, electronic payments such as ACH, NACHA, Wires, and BAC, credit cards, and more. The process includes the communication with financial institutions and the generation of files or documents to be sent to the vendor either through mail or electronically. <!-- Learn more at TODO: ADD LINK Issue and settle vendor payments -->

## Manage vendor debits and chargebacks

This business process area involves reconciling discrepancies in invoices, issuing debit memos, and managing chargebacks in accordance with contractual agreements. It also includes the process of returning products to vendors and disputing charges from vendors. <!-- Learn more at TODO: ADD LINK Manage vendor debits and chargebacks -->

## Create and process promissory notes

This business process area involves creating and managing payment terms and schedules for purchases made on credit. <!-- Learn more at TODO: ADD LINK Create and process promissory notes -->

## Process vendor rebates and incentives

This business process area involves managing and tracking rebates and incentives offered by vendors. It also covers royalty and broker contract management to make sure that the organization receives the full benefit of these programs. <!-- Learn more at TODO: ADD LINK Process vendor rebates and incentives -->

## Analyze vendor performance

This business process area involves analyzing vendor performance by measuring key performance indicators, identifying areas for improvement, and communicating with vendors to ensure continuous improvement. Dynamics 365 includes a [supply risk assessment](/dynamics365/supply-chain/procurement/supply-risk-assessment-overview) workspace with reports for performance and risk analysis to help you understand the risk of sourcing shortages and delays.  <!-- Learn more at TODO: ADD LINK Analyze vendor performance -->
