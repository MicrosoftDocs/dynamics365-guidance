# Copilot in Implementation Portal

This article introduces you to Copilot in the [Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal](https://aka.ms/D365ImplementationPortal). This Copilot helps you find documentation and other guidance for your implementation project. 

## Interact 

Find the icon to launch Copilot in the bottom right corner of any page in the [Dynamics 365 Implementation Portal](https://aka.ms/D365ImplementationPortal).

> [!TIP]
> Copilot in the Implementation Portal uses the [Microsoft Copilot](/copilot/overview) technology.

## Use cases

The first version of Copilot in the Implementation Portal assists users in finding documentation and guidance about our products. For now, it includes all the product documentation for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform and Success by Design and other implementation guidance content.

> [!TIP]
> Try out Copilot by asking the question *"What's new in October 2024 for sales?"*.

We'll add more assistance with projects and other related activities in later updates to the Implementation Portal.
