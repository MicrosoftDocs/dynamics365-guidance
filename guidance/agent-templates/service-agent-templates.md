# Service agent templates

***Applies to***: ***Dynamics 365 Customer Service***

Service agents help organizations resolve routine issues instantly (deflection), while empowering service teams with automation and AI assistance. Intent-driven experiences connect customers to the right answers or the right representative, faster. Behind the scenes, autonomous agents can discover top contact reasons, recommend knowledge, automate case updates and follow-ups, and continuously improve the knowledge base so service stays accurate, targeted, and personalized at scale.
