# What is a functional consultant in Dynamics 365 implementations?

Functional consultants are key to finding the right business solution for an organization. Most often, they work for a Microsoft partner that helps an organization implement a new business solution or tweak the existing solution. They know the business, and they know how to map business needs to product capabilities. But how did they learn all that?

In the remainder of this article, we provide tips to help you get started with Dynamics 365 as a functional consultant.  

## Microsoft Learn

The Microsoft Learn website hosts content to help 'new to Dynamics 365' professionals join projects as a business analyst, designer, or customizer. There's a library of [end-to-end business processes](../business-processes/about.md), and [free training modules](/training/browse/?products=dynamics-365&roles=functional-consultant&resource_type=learning%20path) that conclude with assessments, knowledge checks, and other suggested learning opportunities.  

Jump to the [Find training](#find-training) section to find the right training material. Find the docs you need at [Dynamics 365 documentation](/dynamics365/).  

## Get guidance from an experienced consultant

## Learn the fundamentals

Functional consultants in business apps gather and analyze business requirements to build solutions that modernize processes. They can help increase the return on investment (ROI) while conforming to industry-recommended practices. They serve as a key resource in implementing and configuring applications to meet business requirements. Functional consultants understand application implementation processes including system configuration, data migration, testing, and support.

Functional consultants typically specialize in customer engagement business areas, or in finance and operations business areas. Within each business area, they often specialize further into one or more feature sets. [The end-to-end business processes](../business-processes/index.yml) call out which Dynamics 365 apps support the different business processes. You can also get an overview of the capabilities of each app in [the product-specific documentation](/dynamics365/).

As a functional consultant, you use [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Lifecycle Services](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs), [Power Platform admin center](/power-platform/admin/about-ce-guide), Microsoft Azure DevOps, and other Microsoft tools and platforms to manage the application lifecycle management (ALM) process. Dynamics 365 integrates with Power Platform solutions, external systems, and tools that you must apply to the Dynamics 365 implementation project.
