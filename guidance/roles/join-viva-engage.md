# About the Dynamics 365 partner communities on Viva Engage (formerly Yammer)

The partner communities on Viva Engage provide unique opportunities as a customer or partner to stay up to date on what's going on in the Dynamics 365 engineering teams. We regularly post updates on everything from major and minor updates to events, webinars, and other things you'll find nice to know. You can reach out and ask questions directly to the subject matter experts in the partner community.  

## The Finance and Operations Preview program

The Preview program for Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps is no longer managed through the Experience Dynamics 365 Insider Program. Customers don't have to onboard the Insider Program in order to be part of the Preview community on Viva Engage.

Instead, we encourage our customers to join the Viva Engage **Preview Early Access** group to receive updates on the Preview program and interact with the product team and other customers about the coming release.

### Private feature groups

When you're a part of the **Preview Early Access** group, the product team can onboard you to Viva Engage groups that are private and targeted a specific private feature or feature area. Approvals and onboarding for these groups are managed by the product group program managers responsible for the feature area.

### How to join the Preview Early Access community

- Visit the [Preview Early Access Viva Engage Community page](https://www.yammer.com/dynamicsaxfeedbackprograms/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=12792233) and request to join.
- A Viva Engage administrator reviews the join request and if no concerns, approve. Our service level agreement (SLA) is 24 hours when submitted on a business day, or by end of business day on the following Monday if submitted on a weekend or company holiday.
- When your join request is accepted, you'll receive a second email with important instructions to complete the join process; Choose the provided link to fill in a form for the creation of your profile.
- To complete your sign-up, follow the steps in the guide as outlined in the following main steps:

  - Provide your *First Name*, *Last Name*, *Birthdate*, and *Job Title*. Create a strong password and agree to the network's usage policy.
  - Optionally, join additional/related groups when prompted.
  - Optionally, upload a profile image, or skip this step.

When you have filled in the relevant fields in the guide, you should see the **Preview Early Access** and **All Company** groups automatically listed in the left-side sidebar in your browser. You're now a member of the *Preview Early Access Viva Engage* community and can begin collaborating right away.

As an orientation and welcome to the community, read the group's *Info* page - it's a panel in the right-side sidebar in your browser.

## Business Central partner community

Business Central partners can join the Viva Engage community and find subgroups on topics such as *App Development*, *Onboarding*, *Copilot and AI automation*, *Docs and training*, and more. Learn more at [About Business Central partner community on Viva Engage](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/join-viva-engage).

## Known issue for EU customers

Some customers in the EU are unable to join our Viva Engage network using their company email. For these customers, the recommended workaround is to create a personal email account, such as Outlook.com, gmail.com, or another personal account. They can then repeat the request to join with this account.
