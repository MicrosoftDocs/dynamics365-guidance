The *design to retire* process covers the process for introducing new tangible products. For more information service lifecycle management, see Concept to market.

## Design to retire overview

Design to retire is the process of managing a product from its inception to its eventual end of life. The process typically begins with the development of a product offering idea, which is then refined and tested to ensure it meets customer needs. Once the product is launched, it's important to monitor its performance and make necessary adjustments to keep it competitive in the marketplace. As the product matures, you might want to update or refresh the design to maintain customer interest. Eventually, the product reaches the end of its useful life, and you retire it from the market. Throughout this process, product management requires careful attention to customer needs, market trends, and technological advancements to ensure the product remains relevant and successful.

For engineering type products that are common in the manufacturing industry, the product and lifecycle management process can involve managing complex Bills of Materials (BOM) or formulas. A BOM or formula lists all the parts and components that go into a product, and their relationships to each other. Managing the BOM requires careful attention to ensure that all components are available and in the correct quantities, while also taking into account lead times, availability, and cost. Some organizations offer products that are variable or configurable. In such cases, you can use the *product configurator* in Dynamics 365 to allow customers to select specific features and options for a product. The options that a customer can choose between dynamically update and control the BOM.

For retail organizations, the *design to retire* process often also involves merchandising. Merchandising is the process of selecting and presenting products to customers in a way that maximizes sales. It might include designing product packaging, creating promotional materials, and managing inventory levels to ensure that products are available when customers want them. Dynamics 365 Commerce includes several capabilities to help support the process of enhancing product information with attributes, categorizing products for easy navigation on a website, and relating products to each other. For example, up sell and cross sell products, AI to analyze product other customers purchased to suggest products, and so on. Effective product and lifecycle management requires collaboration between multiple teams, including engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and sales, to ensure that the product is successful throughout its lifecycle.

Every organization has variations to the design to retire. Here, we define the basic outline for any organization looking to implement a technology solution to support the design to retire.

## Impact

The *design to retire* process can have a significant impact on an organization's overall operations and effectiveness. A well-designed process can help organizations to streamline product development, improve collaboration between teams, and ultimately deliver high-quality products to market faster.

When an organization manages the entire product lifecycle in a single system, such as Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, the organization can reduce errors and delays caused by manual data entry or communication breakdowns between teams. It can lead to more efficient product development cycles, as teams can quickly access and share product information, identify issues, and make necessary changes.

Moreover, the tools and features available in Dynamics 365 can help organizations to better understand their products, their components, and their performance throughout their lifecycle. This way, the organization might identify opportunities for cost savings, process improvements, and optimization of resources. By analyzing product data, organizations can gain insights into how to improve product design.

The *design to retire* process can help organizations to improve their agility and responsiveness to changing market needs. With real-time visibility into product development and supply chain operations, organizations can quickly pivot to adjust to changes in customer demand, market trends, or supply chain disruptions.

By identifying potential issues early in the product development cycle, organizations can take corrective action before issues impact product quality or customer satisfaction. That way, the organization can avoid costly product recalls or damage to their reputation.

## Stakeholders

The implementation of Dynamics 365 to support the *design to retire* process requires involvement from multiple stakeholders across the organization. The following list shows some of the key stakeholders that should be involved in the implementation:

- **Product development teams**: Product development teams are responsible for creating and managing product data, including bills of material, formulas, product configurations, and other related data.

- **Merchandising teams**: The merchandising team is responsible for managing product assortments, product placement, and pricing strategies to drive sales and profitability. They must make sure that the system is properly configured to support their needs, including product categorization, product hierarchy, pricing rules, and promotions management.

- **Manufacturing and supply chain teams**: Manufacturing and supply chain teams are responsible for managing the production and delivery of products. They must make sure that the system is properly integrated with manufacturing and supply chain systems and that data is properly managed.

- **Sales and marketing teams**: Sales and marketing teams are responsible for creating and managing sales data, including pricing, promotions, and other related data. They must also make sure that the system is properly integrated with customer relationship management systems.

- **Quality control teams**: Quality control teams are responsible for ensuring that products meet quality standards and that issues are identified and resolved. They must make sure that the system is properly integrated with quality control systems and that data is properly managed.

In summary, the involvement of multiple stakeholders is critical for the successful implementation of Dynamics 365 to support the *design to retire* process. A cross-functional approach is needed to ensure that the system is properly configured, integrated, and optimized to meet the needs of the business.
