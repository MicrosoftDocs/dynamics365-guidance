# Administer to operate end-to-end overview

***Applies to: Dynamics 365***

This article describes the *administer to operate* end-to-end business process flow and its relationship to other business processes that can be used within Dynamics 365.

## Administer to operate process relationship 

The following diagram shows the relationship of other end-to-end processes for the *administer to operate* process. The first column in the diagram for Upstream processes includes all 14 end-to-end processes. The center column for *administer to operate* end-to-end process is broken down into the following business process areas including:

- [Define business continuity plan](administer-to-operate-define-business-continuity-plan-overview.md)

- *Manage licensing and entitlements*

- *Administer system features*

- *Manage system access and security*

- *Train users and increase adoption*

- *Monitor systems, environments, and capacity*

- *Manage background jobs*

- *Manage notifications alerts*

- *Uptake software releases*

- *Manage data synchronization*

- *Manage system compliance*

- *Support systems*

The third column in the diagram displays the downstream business process including all 14 end-to-end business processes.

## Administer to operate business process flow

The following diagram shows the high-level flow of the *administer to operate* business process. The diagram includes a Start and Stop oval at the top and bottom respectively. Around the outside of the graphic are the 14 end-to-end processes arranged alphabetically. Directly below the start box, is the *administer to operate* end-to-end process and all of the business process areas are shown below in the blue boxes. Two large blue arrows are shown around the outside of the business process areas to indicate the processes are cyclical. All 14 end-to-end processes are upstream to *administer to operate* because these business processes inform the decision to implement a new technology solution. All 14 end-to-end processes are downstream to *administer to operate* because the technology supports those processes.
