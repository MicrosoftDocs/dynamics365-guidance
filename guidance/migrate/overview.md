# Migrate to Dynamics 365 online from Dynamics on-premises products

Organizations that run their workloads on-premises but are looking to move to the cloud can migrate to Dynamics 365 online. By moving to the cloud, users get the benefits of cloud scenarios such as Machine Learning, Power BI, Power Automate, and others to drive suggested actions.

Depending on the on-premises solutions, organizations can either run the migration themselves, or they must onboard to Microsoft's migration services. This article lists articles where you can learn more, depending on the products and services that you find more relevant.

## Migrate from Dynamics AX

Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps provide an upgrade path that customers who currently run Dynamics AX 2012 can use to move their data and code to finance and operations apps. Currently, we support upgrades from Dynamics AX 2012 R3 and Dynamics AX 2012 R2. You can also use the Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 Data migration tool (DMT) to migrate your data from Dynamics AX 2009 to Dynamics 365.

Learn more at [Upgrade from AX 2012 to finance and operations](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/upgrade-overview-2012) and [AX 2009 upgrade - Use the Data migration tool to migrate from Dynamics AX 2009 to finance and operations](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/data-migration-tool).  

## Migrate from Dynamics CRM

Microsoft provides guidance on migrating your Dynamics CRM (on-premises) database to Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Dataverse.  

Learn more at [Dynamics CRM to Dynamics 365 online migration process overview](opol-crm-migration-high-level-overview.md).  

## Migrate from Dynamics GP

You can use the built-in migration tools to migrate data to Business Central online from Dynamics GP 2015 and later versions. The on-premises solution must use SQL Server 2016 or a later version, and the database must have compatibility level 130 or higher.  

Learn more at [Dynamics GP migration to Business Central online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-gp-overview).  

## Migrate from Dynamics NAV

You can upgrade to Business Central online from supported versions of Dynamics NAV on-premises, if your application customization is handled by extensions. Any data from tables with code customizations can't be carried forward from Dynamics NAV.
