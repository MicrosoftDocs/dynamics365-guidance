# Overview of the Develop production strategies process area within the Plan to produce process

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Business Central, Dynamics 365 Human Resources, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

This article describes the *develop production strategies* business process area within the *Plan to produce* end-to-end process. This process area includes the processes that establish how the organization intends to run, measure, and account for production. By taking the time to map and analyze production processes, the organization can make better decisions based on real data.

This process area should be implemented whenever any other production processes are implemented. For implementations that include Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain Management, production and other supply chain processes are often part of a second phase. Alternatively, all processes are implemented at once.

## Stakeholders

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of the *develop production strategies* area. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

- **Engineering**: Responsible for designing products and identifying the steps and materials that are required to complete production
- **Human Resources**: Responsible for the workforce/human element of production
- **Operations**: Responsible for managing production
- **Production**: Responsible for running production
- **Warehouse**: Responsible for inventory/material flow in production

## Define production strategies benefits

There are many key benefits that can be used to monitor and measure the success of implementing technology to support the *develop production strategies* business process area. The following sections outline the key benefits that an organization might monitor and measure for *develop production strategies*.  

### Maximize production flexibility through mixed-mode manufacturing

In Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, organizations can model multiple modes of production within the same production site. In this way, they can produce different products through lean, process, or discrete manufacturing, depending on the mode that is the best fit.

### Standardize processes

Organizations can use *routes* to define the standard operating procedures for the production process. They can even attach specific step instructions or pictures to a step, so that operators on the shop floor can easily access them. This approach helps ensure product quality and consistency.

### Visualize and control the cost of production

Functionality for mapping the production process in Dynamics 365 helps businesses understand and accurately capture the cost of production. Therefore, they can make better decisions about purchasing, scheduling, maintenance, and process improvement. Dynamics 365 also includes functionality for defining the cost standards for the production process, and for recording the actual cost of specific production work for variance analysis.

### Maximize production and resource efficiency

Organizations that model their production resources and capacity in Dynamics 365 can create efficient production schedules and, at the same time, respect capacity constraints. They can also use resource certifications and capabilities to ensure that the right resources are selected for the job, regardless of whether those resources are operators or machines. Outsourcing policies can be automated by identifying a vendor as a production resource. Businesses can also report on production operations data to recognize and alleviate bottlenecks in the production process.
