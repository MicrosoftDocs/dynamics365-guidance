# Introduction to the Dynamics 365 agent templates

Organizations can accelerate the adoption of AI agents by deploying prebuilt, templated agents designed around high-value, repeatable use cases. These scenarios are grounded in historical customer demand and industry-specific regulatory requirements, which gives the scenarios strong relevance and broad applicability. These ready-made agents offer rapid enablement and adoption within days, delivering immediate, demonstrable value with clear and measurable return on investment (ROI) for the organization.
