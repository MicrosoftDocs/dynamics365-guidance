# Go-live readiness workshops for Dynamics 365 projects

The Go-live Readiness workshop is designed to help guarantee a successful go-live for Dynamics 365 projects. This workshop covers validations necessary to ensure the solution meets the customerâ€™s needs and expectations, both functional and nonfunctional. The focus is to ensure a smooth transition to Dynamics 365 in the available cutover window and avoid any surprises during and after go-live.

Here are some of the topics the workshop is likely to cover:

-	Confirmation of the go-live date and scope
-	Solution acceptance and user training
-	Performance
-	Integrations
-	Code management
-	Configuration management
-	Review of blocking issues
-	Cutover plan and final data migration
-	Risk and mitigation review
-	Customer go/no-go criteria
-	Support process and hyper-care plan

The typical format is a 90-minute meeting on Microsoft Teams. Mandatory attendees are hyper-care team leads. Recommended attendees include key business users and subject matter experts.
