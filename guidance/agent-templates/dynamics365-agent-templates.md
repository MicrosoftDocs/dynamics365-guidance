# Get Started with Dynamics 365 Agent Templates

Organizations can accelerate adoption of AI Agents by deploying pre-built, templated agents designed around high-value, repeatable use cases. These scenarios are grounded in historical customer demand and industry-specific regulatory requirements, ensuring strong relevance and broad applicability. These ready-made agents offer rapid enablement and adoption within days delivering immediate, demonstrable value with clear and measurable return on investment (ROI) for customers.

## Benefits of Dynamics 365 Agent Templates

Dynamics 365 Agent Templates offer several key advantages:

### Get started quickly

These agents help you get started and experience the power of AI for your business without requiring technical expertise or navigating complex architecture and technology choices. These templates provide clear solutions to business challenges, simplifying your processes and delivering value from the very beginning.

### Industry relevant scenarios

These agents are grounded in real-world demand reflecting frequently requested use cases and regulatory requirements across sectors such as financial services, retail, healthcare, and the public sector.

### Rapid deployment

Because these agents are pre-built, organizations can adopt quickly, enabling fast rollout with minimal configuration. This makes it possible to deploy functional agents within days.

### Clear and measurable value

Each template addresses a known, high-impact business process. The return on investment (ROI) becomes immediately visible, helping customers quickly justify further adoption and expansion.

### Consistency and scalability

Standardized templates provide predictable behaviors, governance alignment, and a repeatable pattern for scaling across use cases, teams, or business units.
