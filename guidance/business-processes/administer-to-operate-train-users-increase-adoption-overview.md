# Train users and increase adoption overview

***Applies to: Dynamics 365, Viva Learn***

This article explains why training your users is key to getting them to adopt your Dynamics 365 solutions and what tools can help you.

When you implement a technology project like Dynamics 365, you need more than just great software. You also need users who can use it well and embrace it. That's where training and adoption come in.

Training helps users unlock the full potential of Dynamics 365. It gives them the skills and confidence they need to work smarter and faster.

Adoption connects technology implementation to business outcomes. It makes sure that the new tools become part of the daily work, not just extra features.

You can use various tools to train your users and increase adoption of Dynamics 365.

- **Microsoft Learn**: Microsoft Learn is a rich source of training resources. It has modules, tutorials, and hands-on labs for Dynamics 365. Users can follow a structured learning path and learn at their own pace. Find training at [Dynamics 365 on Microsoft Learn](/training/dynamics365/).

- **Viva Learn**: Viva Learn focuses on learning and development. It works well with Dynamics 365 implementation. It offers an interactive and personalized learning experience that helps users stay engaged and motivated throughout the learning process. Learn more at [Overview of Microsoft Viva Learning](/viva/learning/overview-viva-learning).

- **Product documentation**: Product documentation is a useful reference tool. It has detailed information about the features and functions of Dynamics 365. Users can find answers to their questions quickly and easily. Find product documentation at [Dynamics 365 documentation](/dynamics365/).

- **Change management and adoption tools**: Besides learning platforms, you also need strong change management and adoption tools. These tools help you make a smooth transition to the new system. They address any resistance to change and ensure that the new processes fit well with the existing workflow. Find adoption resources at [Get ready to adopt Dynamics 365 apps](/dynamics365/adoption/).

- **Guidance from the Dynamics 365 Implementation Guide and Success by Design**: The Dynamics 365 Implementation Guide gives you valuable tips on how to plan and deliver effective training programs and manage change successfully. The Success by Design framework, part of the guide, shows you how to align your technology solutions with your business goals. Find the Dynamics 365 Implementation guide at [Dynamics 365 implementation guidance](../implementation-guide/overview.md).

- **Continuous training and evolution**: Training, change management, and adoption aren't one-time events. They're ongoing processes that support your organizational growth. As Dynamics 365 evolves, so should your users' skills and practices. Review your training plans and change management strategies regularly to keep up with the latest technology updates. See the roadmap at [Release plans for Dynamics 365, Power Platform, and Cloud for Industry](/dynamics365/release-plans/) or use the Release Planner to get ready for [upcoming software releases](https://releaseplans.microsoft.com).

Training and adoption aren't just steps in a project plan. They're the key to realizing the true potential of Dynamics 365. You can achieve successful technology adoption by using tools like Microsoft Learn, Viva Learn, and product documentation. You can also adopt new features quickly and confidently with the guidance of the Dynamics 365 Implementation Guide and the Success by Design framework.

## Stakeholders

Many people in your organization should be involved in the decision-making and design of the *train users and increase adoption* business process area. Here are some examples of such stakeholders:

- **Learning and development stakeholders** include learning and development managers, training specialists, and instructional designers. They create comprehensive training programs, design learning materials, and run workshops to make sure that users are proficient in Dynamics 365.

- **IT stakeholders** include IT managers, system administrators, and technical support specialists. They make sure the technical infrastructure supports the training initiatives, provide technical support during implementation, and work with the learning and development team on technical training needs.

- **Change management stakeholders** include change management consultants, change analysts, and organizational change leads. They develop change management strategies, communicate changes effectively, and assess the impact on user behavior. They also address any resistance to new processes.

- **Human resources stakeholders** include HR managers, talent development specialists, and employee relations coordinators. They align training with organizational goals, facilitate communication, and monitor employee feedback and performance after implementation.

- **End users**. They provide insights on training needs, participate in pilot programs, and promote the benefits of Dynamics 365 within their teams.

- **Executive leadership** includes the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), and Chief Operations Officer (COO). They provide strategic direction, allocate resources and budget, and reinforce the importance of adoption. They also ensure alignment with organizational objectives.
