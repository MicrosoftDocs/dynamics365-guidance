## Define and manage warehouse operations

This process area involves defining and managing warehouse operations, including the setup of warehouses, locations, and zones. It also includes managing the resources required for warehouse operations, such as workers, equipment, and tools<!--For more information, see \[Define and manage warehouse operations link\]TODO:Add link-->.

## Maintain inventory levels

This process area involves managing inventory levels to meet customer demand while minimizing stockouts and overstocks. It includes setting up inventory policies, monitoring stock levels, and creating replenishment plans. This process also includes the management of inventory movements within the warehouse, adjustments for gains and losses of inventory, and cycle counting process as well<!--For more information, see \[Maintain inventory levels link\]TODO:Add link-->.
