# Overview of roles in Dynamics 365

Across Dynamics 365, you're likely to find content that is intended for people with a specific type of job but might be accessed by people with other jobs. You'll also find content that is intended for people across their organization, regardless of their job or role. This article intends to describe the different roles as Microsoft perceives them.  

If you can't find a definition that fits you, don't despair! It just means that we've merged different jobs into a role for simplicity. For example, an article might target a functional consultant but includes content that is relevant for an accountant or a purchasing manager. Or an article might target a developer but can be consumed and understood by a low-code app maker.  

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
|Customer|This role covers two definitions: In guidance and admin content, it's the organization that buys a license for a Microsoft product. In Dynamics 365 business functionality content, it's more often that organization's client or consumer.|
|Partner|This role covers two definitions: In guidance and admin content, it's the organization that sells licenses for Microsoft products. In developer or maker content, it's more often an independent software vendor, ISV, or app provider.|
| Functional consultant | This role covers people that are employed by a Microsoft reselling partner and who helps implement Dynamics 365 for a customer. The role covers many different names and job titles. Learn more at [Functional consultants in Dynamics 365 implementations](functional-consultant.md).|

|Business owner|This role covers the person or people with the final say in which Microsoft services their organization will purchase.|
| Business analyst | This role typically applies to a person who is employed by the customer. The role covers many different names and job titles. |
| Developer | Typically a software engineer, but other profiles can also consume and understand the content. Their employer can be either a partner or the customer. |
|Internal admin|This role covers people that are employed by the organization that uses Dynamics 365 as system administrators or similar jobs. They must approve partner access to their organization's environments, for example.|
|Delegated admin|This role covers people that are employed by a Microsoft reselling partner and are assigned *[granular delegated admin privileges](/partner-center/gdap-introduction)* to their customer's tenants.|
