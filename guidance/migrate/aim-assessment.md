# AIM Assessment

The *Accelerate, Innovate, Move* (AIM) Assessment helps partners conduct a technical and functional review of a customer's current on-premises solution with the goal of building a tailored migration plan. Depending on the solution, partners can conduct this analysis using third-party tools or Microsoft-provided tools for Dynamics AX and Dynamics CRM.

The partner delivers an assessment report that includes a capability overview, dependencies, recommendations, and next steps. The AIM Assessment will help customers understand the benefits of moving from their legacy system to the cloud, tying this transition to current and future business objectives and Dynamics 365 cloud functionality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To request an AIM Assessment, please reach out to your Microsoft representative or partner today!

The AIM Assessment can be offered to customers in combination with other Business Applications Partner Activities, such as an Envisioning Workshop or Solution Assessment, to help customers envision the business value of new cloud- and AI-enabled processes and use cases.

The AIM Assessment includes two dimensions: a functional and a technical assessment. Partners can use their own toolsets or Microsoft-delivered tools to support each phase of the evaluations. Information about the different tools can be found below and on the [Business Applications Partner Hub](https://www.aka.ms/aimforpartners).

## 1. Functional evaluation

A functional assessment examines customers' current business processes and determines how customers might most benefit from the new capabilities and enhancements available in Dynamics 365 in the cloud.

**In this phase, the partner assesses and documents the following:**

- High-level business process and functional review to understand the current on-premises business processes and map those to the capabilities of Dynamics 365 in the cloud.
- High-level assessment of the new capabilities and enhancements in the Dynamics 365 cloud relevant to the customer's business objectives. 
- High-level assessment of customizations and partner solutions implemented, evaluating the partner solutions used, and providing alternatives for partner solutions where relevant (for example, new features in the Dynamics 365 cloud may eliminate the need for a solution from another software development company).

## 2. Technical evaluation

During the technical assessment, the partner identifies the current technical architecture and evaluates different modernization options. 

**In this phase, the partner assesses and documents (at minimum) the following:**

- Integrations: Integrations that will need to be updated to be compatible with the cloud.
- Database: Amount of schema and data that will need to be relocated to the cloud. 
- Custom code: The amount of code that will need to be assessed for cloud readiness. 
- Processes: Custom workflows, business process flows, dialogs, and custom actions that will need to be evaluated for cloud compatibility. 
- Reporting: The amount of custom reports that will need to be refactored and/or rescoped for cloud computability. 
- Licensing: The number and types of Dynamics 365 licenses needed to transition to the cloud.

## 3. Additional evaluation 

- Recommended Upgrade Approach: Assess and recommend the type of migration suited for the customer's needs (for example, lift and shift, hybrid, or reimplementation).
- Next steps in the migration journey.

## 4. Supporting tools 

The following Microsoft tools can be used during the different phases:

- Dynamics CRM (on-premises) to Dynamics 365 online migration process
