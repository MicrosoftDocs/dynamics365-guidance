This article describes how organizations can use Dynamics 365 to introduce new products.

The ability for an organization to create new products in their offerings plays a pivotal role in the growth and innovation of the organization. The business process area involves strategic development, launch and integration of fresh offerings into the market, ensuring that the organization remains competitive and responsive to the evolving customers' needs.

The process of introducing new offerings into the market can vary drastically from industry to industry and geography to geography, among other factors. However, one thing that is certain among all organizations, is that the process can be costly, time consuming, and has a direct impact on the organization's bottom line. For this reason, having strong technology solutions like Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, and the Power Platform are essential to ensure that business decision makers have the right information to make the right decisions.

Organizations can diversify their portfolio, tap into new revenue streams, and strengthen market presence by introducing new products. The Dynamics 365 product suite offers a variety of tools and products to help support this process and products across multiple industries.

For example, Dynamics 365 Customer Service offers capabilities to support tangible products that are offered to customers. Dynamics 365 Commerce offers the capabilities to track sales in the point of sale, online, in a call center, or with integrations from Dynamics 365 Sales or other third-party solutions that help you manage your sales cycle. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management supports the product lifecycle of manufactured products, distributed products, and much more.

With complex support for various types of products across the portfolio, it's important to select the right technologies to support your business needs. When introducing new products, it's important to consider that careful execution of the market research, ideation, rigorous testing, and seamless coordination across departments is executed well.

Dynamics 365 Marketing offers tools to help with many steps, and when used alongside our productivity tools like Microsoft Teams, Planner, and Outlook, and Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, as a few examples, organization can successfully implement solutions to support the process leading to increased customer satisfaction, increased brand reputation, and sustainable growth.

When organizations are looking to implement technological solutions to support the introduction of new products business process, we recommend that these activities are prioritized and planned early in the process. The product data that is captured as part of the business process is critical to many of the downstream processes and poor implementation can cause data quality issues which can lead to other issues later in the project and in the overall business cycle. Keep in mind that product data is considered master data and should be carefully planned and integrated into all downstream business processes.

If you are planning to use a third-party solution for product master data, you can integrate your solution in the first phases of your product and you can look to replace the third-party solution in a later phase. However, careful considerations for the functionality needed should be taken early in the project to avoid reworking later.

## Stakeholders

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of the *Introduce new products* business process area. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

- **Product managers**: Lead the product development process, defining product features, specifications, and market positioning. They ensure that the new offerings align with customer needs and market trends.
