# Overview of the design to retire process areas bring services to market and introduce new products

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

The *design to retire* process is broken down into business process areas for categorizing products, introducing new products, maintaining product data, organizing and assigning product attributes and catalogs, designing and configuring manufactured products, controlling product engineering changes, defining product costing, managing product pricing, managing product assortments and catalogs, and managing product lifecycle. The following sections further describe these business process areas.

The *design to retire* process covers the process for introducing new *tangible products*. Learn more about bringing *services* to market at [Concept to market](concept-to-market-overview.md).

## Define product catalog and strategy

This business process area involves categorizing products based on various attributes, such as the product type, product line, service type, and brand. The exact categories in your organization vary, depending on the types of products that you offer, their complexity, and the industry. Categorization helps organize products and makes it easier for customers to find what they are looking for. Internally, categorization helps you report and analyze trends for your products. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management and Commerce support the creation of category hierarchies to further enhance the discoverability of your products. Learn more at [Define product catalog and strategy overview](design-to-retire-define-product-catalog-strategy-overview.md).

In addition, this business process area involves defining and managing product assortments and catalogs. These processes involve determining which products to offer, creating and maintaining catalogs, and managing inventory levels. Effective management of product assortments and catalogs can help organizations optimize sales and minimize costs. <!-- Learn more at TODOADDLINK[Manage product assortments and catalog\].-->

Finally, this business process area involves organizing and assigning product attributes such as color, size, style, and configuration to products. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management also supports unlimited custom-defined attributes that can be used for reporting and analysis. They can also be shown in the point of sale (POS) or website when you use Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management together with Commerce. Additionally, you can create catalogs to group related products together. When products are organized in this way, customers can more easily find products, and organizations can more easily manage and analyze their product data. <!-- Learn more at TODOADDLINK[Organize and assign product attributes and catalogs\]. -->

## Introduce new products

Every organization has a process for developing and introducing new products to the market. The process includes idea generation, concept development, product design, testing, and launch. Office 365 includes a variety of tools to help you remain organized, and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes tools, such as a configurable workflow, to help with the business process flow of introducing new products. For more basic products, you can also design a business process flow in Dynamics 365 Sales. When you're ready to test new products and advertise them, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights includes a variety of tools to help with the process. A well-managed introduction of new products can help organizations remain competitive and meet customer needs.

Organizations that design or manufacture products have additional processes. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management supports these processes by helping with the design and configuration of manufactured products, including the creation of product designs, bills of materials (BOMs) or formulas, and routing information (manufacturing steps). We also support simpler scenarios where kits or bundles are assembled either in a store or warehouse, for example. Efficient product design and configuration can help organizations reduce costs and improve product quality.

This business process area involves controlling changes that are made to product designs and configurations, to ensure that the changes are properly documented, approved, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes a robust **Engineering change management** module to help organizations manage product changes. Effective change control can help organizations minimize the risk of product defects and improve product quality.

## Define product costing

All organizations must analyze and define the costs that are associated with manufacturing and delivering products. These costs include direct material costs, direct labor costs, and overhead costs. Dynamics 365 Sales includes functionality for assigning basic costs to products. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes more robust costing capabilities. Examples include multiple costing methodologies, such as last in, first out (LIFO), first in, first out (FIFO), standard, and average costing, and cost calculations and roll-ups for manufactured or purchased products, including indirect cost calculations for overheads. An understanding of product costs is essential for setting prices and making informed business decisions.

## Manage product pricing

After you define costs, you can start to manage and define product prices, based on factors such as cost, competition, and customer demand. Effective pricing strategies can help organizations improve profitability and maintain a competitive advantage. Dynamics 365 Sales includes basic sales pricing functionality. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management has a pricing engine that includes trade agreements, price lists, customer loyalty programs, promotions, and discounts to help determine the best price. <!-- Learn more at TODOADDLINK[Manage product pricing\].-->

Learn more at [Manage product pricing overview](design-to-retire-manage-product-pricing-overview.md).  

## Manage product lifecycle

This business process area involves managing the entire lifecycle of a product, from ideation to retirement. Management of the product lifecycle involves making strategic decisions about product development, pricing, and marketing, to help ensure that the product remains profitable and relevant to the market.
