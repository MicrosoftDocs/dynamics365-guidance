# Implementation workshops for the Acquire to dispose business processes

This article outlines prerequisites, stakeholders, and key questions for three types of workshops that we recommend you include as part of an implementation project that covers the *acquire to dispose* end-to-end business process.

## Discovery workshop with a scenario board

The *acquire to dispose* scenario board discovery workshop is designed to help establish a comprehensive understanding of the end-to-end asset management process from acquisition to disposal for all key stakeholders in the implementation of Dynamics 365 to support these processes. This workshop will guide participants through the key scenarios and business process areas involved in the *acquire to dispose* process. By leveraging visual representations and interactive discussions, the workshop aims to align all stakeholders on the vision for the project and ensure that the new technology solution meets the needs of its users. Participants will engage in identifying key scenarios, goals, and key inputs and outputs for the processes. The workshop serves as a valuable tool for communication and collaboration, helping to refine the proposed scope and allows the partner to create an initial design proposal.

## Storyline design review workshop

The *acquire to dispose* storyline design review workshop is a crucial step in refining the design of the asset management process. This workshop focuses on reviewing the storyline or "happy path" defined in the acquire to dispose scenario board discovery workshop, conducting a fit-to-standard review, reviewing the configured the solution, and reviewing high-level designs and slides for parts that cannot be demonstrated.

This workshop takes place after the initial acquire to dispose scenario board workshop and is based on the initial discovery phase. During this session, we delve deeper into the chosen storyline or "happy path", ensuring that it aligns with business requirements and standards. We also identify any gaps or areas that need further refinement.

By the end of this workshop, the aim is to achieve 80-90% accuracy and acceptance for the selected storyline, ensuring that we are well-prepared for the next phases of the project.

### Key activities for the storyline design review

- Review the storyline: Revisit the storyline or "happy path" selected during the initial discovery phase, ensuring it meets business needs and aligns with the strategic goals.

- Fit-to-standard review: Conduct a thorough review to ensure that the proposed solution fits within the standard processes and guidelines.

- Demonstrate the solution: Demonstrate the built-in capabilities and address any issues or challenges that arise. Make sure that the focus is on the primary storyline selected in the initial workshop.

- Review other components and design proposals: For parts of the process that cannot be demonstrated live, review slides or other resources to help illustrate the workflow and key points of the proposed design.

### Assumptions for the storyline design review

## Detailed design workshops

For each of the *acquire to dispose* business process areas that the implementation project must include, we recommend that you have a dedicated design workshop where you dig into needs, concerns, and specific requirements. Each design workshop has almost the same agenda, but there are probably different stakeholders, and there might be different compliance and regulatory concerns.
