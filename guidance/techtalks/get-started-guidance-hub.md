# TechTalk: Introduction to the Dynamics 365 guidance hub

In this article, we explore the Dynamics 365 guidance hub, a centralized platform designed to streamline your Dynamics 365 experience.  

We based this article on [a TechTalk](https://youtu.be/NwiNJSbSmh8?si=F-IL4kxfBJhUNN_y) that you can find online in the Dynamics 365 channel on YouTube.

## Introduction to Dynamics 365 guidance hub

The Dynamics 365 guidance hub is your gateway to a wealth of Dynamics 365 resources. It's a comprehensive repository for documentation and guidance about tools and resources to support you on your Dynamics 365 journey. It's updated every two weeks so that users have access to the latest information and tools necessary for their projects.

## Key features of the Dynamics 365 guidance hub

The guidance hub is not product-specific but encompasses a wide array of content relevant to Dynamics 365 applications. It includes documentation and guidance on various resources, including the following list:

- **Business process guides**: The guidance hub includes detailed business process guides, each focusing on a specific business process. These guides include flowcharts, implementation advice, and insights into potential issues and considerations. The business processes are organized into [15 end-to-end scenarios](../business-processes/overview.md), and each is aligned with the business process catalog, available for download at [https://aka.ms/businessprocesscatalog](https://aka.ms/businessprocesscatalog).  
- **Implementation guide**: We converted a large PDF document into more accessible and searchable articles on Microsoft Learn. The implementation guide is organized by the phases of implementation—*strategize*, *initiate*, *implement*, *prepare*, and *operate*—making it easier for users to find relevant content at each stage of their project.
- **Glossary of terms**: We provide a growing glossary to help users understand the terminology used across Dynamics 365 products. The glossary grows with new terms when we publish new articles. We encourage our users to provide feedback or contribute new terms directly through the site.
- **Tools and resources**: The hub documents tools and resources that are tailored to specific Dynamics 365 apps and services. The resources include detailed instructions on installation, configuration, and usage, often accompanied by downloadable resources from the GitHub repository.  

## Navigating the guidance hub

The hub's interface is user-friendly and intuitive, allowing easy navigation. You can find sections for business process guides, implementation guides, tools, and resources, each meticulously detailed to cater to specific needs and provide practical insights.

## Engaging with Microsoft
