# Agent for case categorization and enrichment

***Applies to***: ***Dynamics 365 Customer Service***

Eliminates manual data entry and reduces case handling time by automatically extracting information from customer interactions and intelligently populating case fields with AI-predicted values. This can automatically categorize the cases so they are routed to the correct team, eliminating the need for a manual triage or passing back and forth between teams.
