# TechTalk: Implementation approach with agile techniques for Dynamics 365 business solutions

Discover the transformative potential of agile techniques in Dynamics 365 implementation, a strategic approach that enhances adaptability and accelerates deployment in today's dynamic business landscape.

In today's fast-paced business environment, implementing business applications rapidly and effectively is crucial. Dynamics 365 is a powerful suite of business applications that can transform business processes. However, the traditional waterfall approach to implementation may not always be the best fit for every organization or project. Agile techniques offer an alternative that can lead to quicker deployment and better alignment with business needs.

We based this article on [a TechTalk](https://youtu.be/K9zpwNWRqQA?si=-MaaA2LVfO1mprCc) that you can find online in the Dynamics 365 channel on YouTube.

## Agile vs. waterfall

In a waterfall implementation, the project is meticulously planned upfront, and each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. While this method has its advantages, such as a clear structure and well-defined deliverables, it can also be inflexible and slow to respond to changes.

Agile, on the other hand, is iterative and incremental. Work is divided into small chunks, and each part of the project is revisited throughout its lifecycle. This allows for more flexibility, quicker iterations, and the ability to adapt to changes rapidly.

## Dynamics 365 and agile: A strategic approach

Combining Dynamics 365 implementations with agile techniques requires a strategic approach that considers the complexities of both the platform and the agile methodology.

### Step 1: Preparing for agile Dynamics 365 implementation

- **Understand business processes**: Begin with a thorough understanding of the business processes that Dynamics 365 will support. This requires close collaboration with business stakeholders to map out the processes in detail.

- **Assemble the right team**: Agile relies on cross-functional teams working closely together. Ensure that your team includes members with a mix of skills, including Dynamics 365 experts, business analysts, developers, and QA specialists.

- **Define the project scope**: Establish a clear project scope that includes what will be implemented in Dynamics 365, keeping in mind that agile allows for adjustments along the way.

### Step 2: Sprint planning

**Break down work into sprints**: Divide the implementation work into sprints, typically 2-4 weeks long, focusing on delivering a set of features at the end of each sprint.

**Prioritize features**: Work with stakeholders to prioritize features based on business value and urgency. This helps to ensure that the most important features are developed first.

**Develop user stories**: Create user stories that describe the features from an end-user perspective, providing clarity on what needs to be implemented.

### Step 3: Sprint execution

**Daily stand-ups**: Hold daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, identify any blockers, and adjust plans as necessary.

**Collaborative work**: Encourage team collaboration, with developers, testers, and business analysts working together to ensure features meet business requirements.

**Continuous testing**: Implement continuous testing to catch issues early and ensure quality throughout the sprint.

### Step 4: Review and retrospectives

**Sprint review**: At the end of each sprint, hold a review meeting with stakeholders to demonstrate the completed features and gather feedback.

**Retrospective**: Conduct a retrospective meeting with the team to reflect on what went well, what didn't, and how processes can be improved in the next sprint.

### Step 5: Release and iterate

:::image type="content" source="media/implementation-approach-with-agile-techniques-7.svg" alt-text="Screenshot of the Monitoring, reporting, and adjusting presentation slide, outlining the prereqs steps, and goal of the step." lightbox="media/implementation-approach-with-agile-techniques-7.svg":::

**Prepare for release**: Once a set of features is ready, prepare for the release by conducting end-to-end testing and user training.

**Go live**: Deploy the features to the production environment, ensuring that support mechanisms are in place for users.

**Iterate**: After the release, gather feedback, and begin planning for the next set of features or improvements.

## Challenges and solutions

- **Change management**: Agile requires a cultural shift. Encourage an open mindset and flexibility among team members and stakeholders.

- **Integration complexity**: Dynamics 365 may need to integrate with other systems. Plan for this complexity by involving integration experts early in the sprint planning.

- **Customization vs. configuration**: Strive to use out-of-the-box features as much as possible to minimize complexity and maintain agility.

## Conclusion

Implementing Dynamics 365 using agile techniques can offer significant benefits, including increased flexibility, improved stakeholder engagement, and faster delivery of business value. By following the steps outlined above and being prepared to face the associated challenges head-on, organizations can achieve a successful and agile Dynamics 365 implementation.
