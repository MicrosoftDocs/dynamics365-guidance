# Pursue opportunities overview

Applies to: ***Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

This article provides an overview of pursuing sales opportunities by using Dynamics 365 Sales to nurture and close deals to meet revenue targets. Consistently progressing qualified leads toward won deals is essential for sales success. Dynamics 365 Sales enables data-driven opportunity management to improve forecast accuracy, win rates, and deal velocity.

The opportunity process starts by capturing new potential deals in the pipeline. Details such as products, competitors, and stakeholders help qualify the likelihood of closure. Opportunities are then nurtured through ongoing communication and engagement activities that are tracked in Dynamics 365. Scoring models analyze attributes to prioritize higher-potential deals.

As opportunities proceed toward a sale, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management provides real-time visibility into inventory availability for quoting. Price negotiation and approvals are streamlined. Finalized quotes are converted to orders when deals are won. Loss analysis helps improve the sales process.

Through integrated visibility into the entire opportunity lifecycle, sales teams can optimize deal progress for increased sales performance. Dynamics 365 Sales provides intelligent tools to guide opportunity development based on historical data and emerging trends. Early implementation of robust opportunity management establishes a solid foundation for growth.

## Key stakeholders
