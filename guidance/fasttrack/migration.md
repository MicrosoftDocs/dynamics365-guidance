# Dynamics CRM (on-premises) to Dynamics 365 migration

Microsoft provides guidance on migrating your Dynamics CRM (on-premises) database to [Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro#dynamics-365-and-dataverse). We provide guidance in the form of tools and documentation and by performing configuration tasks where applicable and feasible. This is available for all eligible customers with [supported versions of Dynamics CRM](/lifecycle/products/?terms=Dynamics%20CRM).

## On-premises to online nomination

Partners and customers can nominate for the migration services for on-premises to online (OP2OL) through the [self-serve tool](https://aka.ms/op2olnom).

## Recommended next steps

Detailed recommended steps about the tool and program can be found at [Dynamics CRM to Dynamics 365 online migration process overview](../migrate/opol-crm-migration-high-level-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the OP2OL migration services support Dynamics CRM 2016 (on-premises) and later versions.
