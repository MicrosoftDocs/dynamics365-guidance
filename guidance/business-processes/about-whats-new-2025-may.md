# What's new or changed in the business process catalog in May 2025

The business process catalog is a standard list of business processes across Dynamics 365 apps and services. It's an Excel workbook that we at Microsoft use to organize and prioritize our work on the business process documentation.

The May 2025 release of the catalog includes improvements across many of the end-to-end processes. It also includes improvements suggested by our user community through our GitHub issue list and Partner Advisory Board Focus Group. Download the latest version of the catalog from [https://aka.ms/businessprocesscatalog](https://aka.ms/businessprocesscatalog).

## Deprecated rows

The May 2025 version of the business process catalog includes rows with the catalog status set to **Deprecated**. These rows are no longer active and will be removed in a future release of the catalog. Many of these rows are moved to a location in the catalog. The **Alternate Process Sequence ID** column specifies if the deprecated row is available in a new location in the catalog.

## Deleted rows

The May 2025 version of the business process catalog includes rows with the catalog status set to **Deleted**. Any row that is marked as deleted won't be listed in the future releases of the catalog. If you actively use a row that is now tagged as deleted, we recommend that you update your catalog to use the row that is designated in the **Alternative process sequence ID** column for the deleted entry.

## Process flow diagrams

We're excited to announce more process flow diagrams for Level 3 processes. We generated these diagrams with the help of AI, and you can download them from the GitHub repository at [https://aka.ms/businessprocessflow](https://aka.ms/businessprocessflow). BPMN 2.0 cross-functional flow diagrams are now available for the following areas:

- Concept to market
- Forecast to plan
- Service to deliver

These flow diagrams are basic and can be used for any system an organization uses. We recommend using these diagrams to help accelerate the discovery process when implementing technology solutions such as Dynamics 365. These diagrams are intended to be used as a starting point and customized for each organization.

## Pitch decks by end-to-end processes

10 ERP business process pitch decks are now available on Partner Hub. These decks are designed for partners to help make the sales and discovery processes easier. Each deck aligns to the business process catalog and can help you map each process area to the features and benefits of using Dynamics 365 to support those processes. Microsoft partners can download the resources from the **Business Process Pitch Decks** area at [https://aka.ms/PartnerHubProcessContent](https://aka.ms/PartnerHubProcessContent).

Full list of ERP processes:

- Acquire to dispose
- Design to retire
- Forecast to plan
- Hire to retire
- Inventory to deliver
- Order to cash
- Plan to produce
- Project to profit
- Source to pay
- Record to report

## Business process demo scripts

New business process-focused demo scripts are available for five end-to-end processes in Partner Hub. These demo scripts are designed to help sellers and technical sellers to demonstrate the features of Dynamics 365 aligned with business processes that differentiate our products in the marketplace.  

Each demo script includes a downloadable Word document with screenshots and the script for the demo. The document also includes a link to open a simulated click-through demonstration of the software in a browser. By default, the guides are enabled for the demonstrations that include the guidance about where to click, and the script from the Word document. We recommend that you use the guides to learn the process that is being demonstrated in the click-through. When you're ready to show the demonstration to a customer or a prospect, we recommend that you select the Menu icon in the lower-right corner, and then choose the option to switch off the guides. You must select the correct element in the page to advance to the next step. You can use the *Ctrl* button on your keyboard to highlight the element that must be selected. You can also use the left and right arrow buttons on your keyboard to move forward or backward in the demo script. The Menu for each click-through includes a table of contents that allows you to jump to different parts of the demo. Each level 2 business process area includes a topic in the table of contents of each demo.

Full list of demo scripts currently available:

- Hire to retire
- Inventory to deliver
- Plan to produce
- Source to pay

## Workshops templates

The May 2025 release of the business process catalog introduces a comprehensive set of workshop templates designed to streamline collaboration and decision-making across key business areas. These templates are structured to enhance engagement and ensure precise alignment with business goals. The following list outlines the core structure of the workshops, a detailed list of processes that include workshops in this release, and an overview of the three distinct workshop types:  

- Storyboard  

- Storyline Design Review

- Deep-Dive Design

### Workshop template structure

Each workshop template includes the following items:

- A clear agenda to guide participants through the session's objectives.
- Predefined tools and resources tailored to facilitate effective collaboration.
- Comprehensive instructions to ensure consistency and alignment with best practices.

The templates are designed to be flexible and scalable, accommodating the unique needs of sellers, technical sellers, solution architects, business analysts, and functional consultants.

### Processes featuring workshops in this release

The following end-to-end processes now include workshop templates as part of the May 2025 release:

- Design to retire
- Forecast to plan
- Inventory to deliver
- Hire to retire
- Order to cash 
- Source to pay

### Workshop types

Three workshop types are included for each end-to-end process. Each workshop template is tailored to specific stages of the business process design and refinement.

- **Storyboard design workshops**

  These workshops are highly visual and focus on mapping out the entire business process. Participants collaborate to create a high-level overview of the business processes, scenarios, and objectives, identifying key milestones and potential bottlenecks. The objective is to establish a shared vision and roadmap. We recommend that you run these workshops early in the presales stage of an engagement to help the team get a better understanding of the customer's business needs and create a demo plan. 

  Each storyboard design workshop includes the following components:

  - A storyboard graphic in the Visio file that is available for the end-to-end business process in the GitHub repository. Download the Visio files at [https://aka.ms/businessprocessflow](https://aka.ms/businessprocessflow).  
  - A Word document template for the workshop. Download the Word document template files at [https://aka.ms/businessprocessworkshops](https://aka.ms/businessprocessworkshops).  
  - Work items in the Azure DevOps template. There's one work item of type Workshop for the overall workshop including the details of the workshop from the template, and Tasks that are children work items under the parent Workshop work item.  
- **Storyline design review workshops**
  In these sessions, the primary scenario is demonstrated to the customer in Dynamics 365. Teams delve into the specifics of the business process in Dynamics 365. The goal is to review and refine the storyline behind the process and conduct a fit-to-standard analysis, ensuring all steps are aligned with strategic objectives. Feedback loops are built into the session to address gaps or inconsistencies. 

  Each Storyline design review workshop includes the following components:

  - A Word document template for the workshop. The Word document template files can be downloaded at [https://aka.ms/businessprocessworkshops](https://aka.ms/businessprocessworkshops).  
  - Work items in the Azure DevOps template. here's one work item of type Workshop for the overall workshop including the details of the workshop from the template, and Tasks that are children work items under the parent Workshop work item. 
- **Deep-dive design workshops**
  These workshops are designed for thorough exploration of intricate process details. The focus is on addressing complex challenges, testing assumptions, and finalizing designs. They're useful for processes requiring cross-functional alignment and technical input. The implementation team can run these workshops in the *Implement* phase of a project. Each level two business process area in the catalog includes at least one Deep-dive design workshop. However, some business process areas can include multiple workshops. 

  - A Word document template for the workshop. The Word document template files can be downloaded at [https://aka.ms/businessprocessworkshops](https://aka.ms/businessprocessworkshops).
  - Work items in the Azure DevOps template. There's one work item of type Workshop for the overall workshop including the details of the workshop from the template. These workshops don't include detailed tasks. However, the catalog includes configuration deliverables that define most of the work that functional consultants must do in order for the process to work according to the customers business requirements. 

### Using the workshop templates in Azure DevOps

While there isn't one specific way to use the templates and work items provided in the business process catalog, the following list of tips and tricks can be used to help ensure good management and governance of the process:

- Document each business requirement using Requirement type work items.
- Document Risks, Issues, Actions, and Decisions (RAID) log items using the related work item types.
- Create Task type work items to track specific tasks that need to be completed or followed up on by the project team.
- Work items should be linked to the lowest possible level of the business process catalog, typically level four scenarios. However, if a business requirement is more general, it might be appropriate to link it to a higher-level business process or area.

## Dynamics 365 Business Central scenarios

More than 600 new scenarios are now available in the catalog for Dynamics 365 Business Central. These scenarios make the catalog easier to use for customers and partners looking to implement Dynamics 365 Business Central or compare it with Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps. The community contributed to these new work items, and BDO contributed significantly to them.

## More metadata for Administer to operate

To enhance the functionality and usability of the Administer to operate section within the business process catalog, we have introduced several new columns that provide a more structured and comprehensive framework for managing processes. These additions aim to streamline collaboration, improve clarity, and facilitate better decision-making during implementation and operations.

- **Responsible party**: Identifies if it's the customer or their partner that's responsible for the execution and oversight of the specific process or task.
- **Role type**: Defines a category of roles involved with the task including Functional, Technical, or Governance.
- **Program areas**: Specifies a more specific organizational segment or initiative under which the process falls, ensuring alignment with strategic goals.
- **Responsible role**: Pinpoints the specific role tasked with the management or delivery of the process, bridging gaps between general accountability and individual tasks.
- **Contributor**: Lists entities or stakeholders who provide inputs or support the process execution, fostering collaboration across teams.
- **Estimated complexity**: Offers a default assessment of how challenging the process is in terms of resources, skills, or time required, aiding in effective planning.
- **Estimated project impact**: Evaluates the potential influence of the process on project objectives and outcomes, ensuring key activities are prioritized.
- **Success by Design phase**: Maps the process or task to specific phases of the Success by Design framework that promotes structured and phased execution and helps project managers determine when tasks should be completed during the project.
- **Estimated frequency**: Indicates how often the process or tasks is expected to occur, helping teams prepare adequately for recurring or ad-hoc requirements.

These new attributes not only refine the operational structure of the Administer to operate section but also empower users with better insights for planning, governance, and execution. 

> [!NOTE]
> These new columns must be added to Azure DevOps before the catalog can be imported into your Azure DevOps project.

## New configuration deliverable work items

The May 2025 version of the catalog includes more than 800 new configuration deliverables that cover more modules and features in finance and operations apps.  

## Improved tagging on scenarios

Scenarios now include two new columns for the Workload type and Products. All level four Scenarios in the catalog for the functional end-to-end processes have been updated with the value indicating which workload type and products the scenario it applies to.

The workload types make it easier to identify which scenarios apply to your project so you can easily remove or mark the scenarios out of scope when applicable. The Workload type column includes the following values:

- Business Central
- Cross-functional
- Customer engagement apps
- Finance and operations apps
- Productivity

## Improvements to Concept to market

The Concept to market end-to-end process has undergone a comprehensive overhaul to better align with evolving market demands and the Dynamics 365 product ecosystem. While the previous structure primarily focused on service lifecycle management, the updated framework has been expanded to incorporate a broader range of marketing and conceptualization processes. 

The new structure emphasizes marketing as an integral part of the conceptualization and product development journey. This includes a detailed representation of customer journey mapping and better alignment with Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Data and Journeys products. Processes now begin earlier in the lifecycle, covering initial idea generation and market analysis, ensuring greater synergy between design, marketing, and implementation phases. 

The framework for Concept to market in earlier versions of the catalog is now entirely deprecated to pave the way for a more streamlined and comprehensive process flow. To ensure continuity and clarity, the old rows from the previous structure weren't removed. Instead, we carefully updated them with alternative process sequence IDs and annotated them with summarized descriptions regarding their new placement.

## Improvements to Forecast to plan processes

The *forecast to plan* end-to-end process has undergone more updates to align with the marketing pitch deck and industry standards. These changes enhance efficiency and clarity. Here are the key changes:

- Updated names: We updated the names of the following business process areas:

  - 50.25 *Develop sales and marketing strategy* is now *Conduct sales and operations planning*.
  - 50.35 *Conduct supply chain planning* is now *Execute sales and operations*.
- Merged process: We merged and moved the processes from 50.45 *Conduct operational planning* into the newly renamed process areas for *Conduct sales and operations planning* and *Execute operations planning*.
- New scenarios: We introduced many new scenarios across the *forecast to plan* end-to-end process. More changes will come in future releases. 

## Improvements to Service to deliver processes

In our latest release, we made significant updates to the *Service to deliver* process to enhance its structure and better align it with its new name and purpose. We renamed the end-to-end scenario from *Service to cash* to *Service to deliver*. This renaming reflects a more focused alignment with the delivery aspects of intangible services.

As part of this update, we deprecated all rows under the previous structure and mapped them to the new structure. The new structure eliminates redundancies and offers clear distinctions between related end-to-end processes. Notably, the old *Service to cash* structure duplicated several processes from the *Order to cash* structure. We removed these duplications to support a more streamlined and logical framework.

The updated *Service to deliver* process is now closely aligned with the *Inventory to deliver* process. This alignment ensures that tangible and intangible product delivery processes are more distinctly separated. The *Order to cash* process retains all selling functions, encompassing both tangible and intangible products, as well as finance-related functions such as invoicing, capturing payments, and collections.

The refined structure gives us a clearer exit point from the *Order to cash* process. For tangible products, the process transitions to the *Inventory to deliver* process. For intangible services, the transition occurs to the new *Service to deliver* process. This separation enhances clarity and ensures that each process is appropriately tailored to its specific domain of execution.

We implemented these changes to ensure a more cohesive and efficient process design, aligning with the overarching goals of simplifying workflows and improving operational clarity.
