***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Human Resources, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

This article describes how you can use Dynamics 365 products to *Develop people strategy* as part of the *hire to retire* end-to-end scenario. Planning the people strategy represent a foundational business process area that is upstream of most business processes across a business. It's important that you define department structures, and define and manage jobs and positions, so that you can assign workers to tasks. In addition, before you can record time and attendance, and pay employees, you must create and manage shifts, and define work calendars and schedules. You should Develop people strategy early in the implementation, because the associated configurations are required to support day-to-day operations and business processes.

Input from various stakeholders is required to complete these steps. The list includes but isn't limited to the following roles:

- **Finance** is required to define the relevant financial dimensions.
- **HR** and **Administrative stakeholders** are required to define organizational details.
- **IT Operations** might be required to import data.
