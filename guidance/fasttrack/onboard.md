# Onboard a Dynamics 365 project with or without FastTrack nomination

Since January 1, 2021, customer nominations are required for FastTrack engagements across the Dynamics 365 application suite. Eligible customers can work with their qualified partner or assigned Microsoft account manager, if applicable, to request a FastTrack for Dynamics 365 engagement.

- [Link to nominate customers (for Microsoft field)](https://aka.ms/D365FTNom)
- [Link to nominate customers (for partners)](https://aka.ms/ftnomportal)

Once a nomination is submitted, the regional FastTrack for Dynamics 365 lead evaluates the eligibility and assign the customer to a FastTrack engineering resource. If a nomination doesn't meet the required eligibility, an exception must be submitted.

Microsoft makes the following requirements to onboard an organization:

- The organization must have an implementation partner.  
- All implementation partners must have the *Cloud Business Applications* silver or gold competency.
- All implementation partners must complete the Success by Design training before project initiation.

## Exception process

FastTrack exceptions must be granted by the regional leadership team. To request an exception, please reach out to your Microsoft contact for review.

## Onboard a Dynamics 365 project without FastTrack nomination

For customers not nominated to FastTrack, light-touch implementation guidance is available at [Dynamics 365 implementation guidance](../implementation-guide/overview.md).  

## Implementation project

You can onboard your organization as self-service in Lifecycle Services if you're not nominated for FastTrack. Learn more at [LCS workspace for the current versions of the finance and operations apps](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs-works-lcs#lcs-workspace-for-the-current-versions-of-the-finance-and-operations-apps) in the Lifecycle Services content.  

After the Implementation project workspace is provisioned in Lifecycle Services, the Microsoft FastTrack team will monitor your onboarding progress. If project onboarding isn't completed within a few weeks after creating a Lifecycle Services implementation project, a reminder will be sent to the project team. It's important that the project onboarding in Lifecycle Services is completed with the most accurate date, and that the email addresses listed in the setup are monitored. Learn more at [Project onboarding](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/project-onboarding) in the Lifecycle Services content.
