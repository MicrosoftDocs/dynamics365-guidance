# Create well-run lead management with the identify and qualify leads business process area

Applies to: ***Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data, Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection***

This article provides an overview of using Dynamics 365 to identify and qualify leads, and therefore drive sales pipeline growth and revenue. Well-run lead management encompasses generating, nurturing, scoring, and qualifying leads to feed the sales pipeline.

The lead management process starts by identifying leads from various sources, such as marketing campaigns, events, inbound inquiries, and referrals. Dynamics 365 enables automated lead capture and creation, to gather leads from digital interactions. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights and Dynamics 365 Sales can work together to score and nurture leads over time, through tools such as predictive lead scoring and targeted content campaigns. Customer service also plays a role by capturing and routing leads from support interactions.

After leads are identified and enriched, the next pivotal process is lead qualification and conversion. Sales reps use lead attributes and behaviors to determine sales readiness, based on fit, interest, and timing. Qualified leads can then be converted into sales pipeline opportunities for further nurturing toward a sale. Dynamics 365 provides integrated tools for Customer Insights and Sales to seamlessly transition through the lead lifecycle.

Proactive lead management is vital for driving sales growth. Dynamics 365 enables data-driven automation and collaboration between teams to maximize lead generation and conversion. A structured lead lifecycle helps ensure that no potential opportunities are missed. Although processes can be refined over time, early establishment of an effective lead management framework sets the stage for sales success.

## Key stakeholders

- **Marketing**: Generate and nurture leads.
