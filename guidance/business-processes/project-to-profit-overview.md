## Project to profit process relationship

The following diagram shows the relationship of other processes and products/features for the project to profit process.

There are several processes that are often prerequisites to the *project to profit* process, including the following list:

<!-- - **Case to resolution**  

  When you require a robust approval process before starting a new project, you can use case management features to help drive the request and manage the onboarding of a new project. -->

- **Order to cash**  

  The *order to cash* process can be upstream to the *project to profit* process, if your organization sells tangible items that lead to a larger project. For example, installation or warranty that is related to a tangible product.

- **Design to retire**  

  This process can be an upstream process in two senses.  

  1. When you define the details for your project contract lines, or estimate projects, you can add items to the estimate. But first, you must configure the *design to retire* process.  

  2. Product lifecycle management might initiate a project to create or revise a product.

- **Prospect to quote**  

  Most organizations use some sort of quoting or opportunity management process for larger projects. If you plan to use Dynamics 365 to support this process, you must configure the *prospect to quote* process to support the creation of leads, opportunities, and quotes, for example.

<!-- - **Service to cash**  

  If your organization sells services such as maintenance, installation, or warranties, the *service to cash* process can be upstream to the *project to profit* process. -->

The *project to profit* end-to-end process is broken down into the following business process areas:

- Govern projects

- Manage project contracts

- Manage project resources and schedule

- Manage project delivery

- Manage project financials

- Monitor and analyze project performance

Learn more about the business process areas at [Project to profit business process areas](project-to-profit-areas.md).

The downstream processes for the project to profit process include the following list:

- **Acquire to dispose**  

  A primary goal of a project might be the creation of an asset that has a long useful life. You might have to amortize the accounting value of the asset over its lifetime. When the asset enters service, the accumulated costs of the project become the acquisition value of a new fixed asset that is managed via the *Acquire to dispose* business process.

- **Case to resolution**  

  The *case to resolution* downstream process might start after an initial sale of a product or service as part of a project. For example, a company sells a software product to implement an enterprise solution. After the project is completed, the customer experiences issues. In such cases, the *case to resolution* process can be triggered to track and manage resolution of the issue.

- **Inventory to deliver**  

  As for the *order to cash* process, if a project includes the sale of tangible, stocked products, the normal downstream *inventory to deliver* process applies to picking, packing, and shipping the product.

- **Order to cash**  

  *Order to cash* can be downstream to *project to profit*. The sale of tangible or intangible products to customers is often within the scope of a project. For example, a project involves selling a software license and delivering work to implement it on behalf of a customer. For such products, the normal *order to cash* process often applies. This process includes entering sales orders, delivering the product, invoicing for it, and processing customer payments.

- **Plan to produce**  

  In scenarios such as *engineer to order* or *build to order* manufacturing, you often manage the production of subassemblies or finished products as part of the project. For example, a manufacturer wins a contract to design, build, and commission custom equipment. Because the project takes months, or even years, and encompasses many cost components, the manufacturer manages the contract as one or more discrete projects.

- **Design to retire**  

  A project might be intended to create or revise products to be sold and thus provide inputs to a downstream end-to-end process.

- **Source to pay**  

  The *Source to pay* process involves purchasing goods and services and making payments for them. In most organizations, the procurement of various materials and equipment is necessary to complete a project. If you plan to use Dynamics 365 Project Operations to support your organization, make sure you configure the *Source to pay* process for tasks such as the following list:

  - Create purchase requisitions  

  - Create purchase orders  

  - Receive goods and services  

  - Invoice approvals  

  - Invoice payments  

  - Make financial reconciliation  

- **Record to report**  

  The *record to report* downstream process involves the following tasks:  

  - Recording generated revenue from the project as a financial transaction  

  - Performing reconciliation to ensure all financial transactions recorded accurately  

  - Preparing financial statements  

  - Analyzing financial data  

  - Closing the accounting period  

- **Service to cash**  

  *Service to cash* can be downstream to *project to profit*. For example, you sell intangible services such as consulting or health care services to customers. This process involves steps such as the following list:  

  - Providing a service  

  - Generating the service report for the services provided  

  - Invoicing for the service  

  - Processing customer payment  

## Featured capabilities

There are product-specific capabilities that interact with the *project to profit* process including, but not limited to, the following list:

- **Project Sales**

  Dynamics 365 Project Operations encompasses rich capabilities to win more deals and accelerate the sales cycle with fast and accurate quotes, flexible pricing, and seamless transitions from estimate to execution.

- **Project for the Web**

  Project for the web is a project management tool offered by Dynamics 365. It's a cloud-based application that enables businesses to manage their projects, resources, and budgets in a centralized location. With Project for the web, users can create, manage, and track projects from start to finish, allowing them to stay on top of deadlines, resource allocation, and project progress.

- **Universal Resource Scheduling**

  Universal Resource Scheduling is an advanced scheduling engine in Dynamics 365 Project Operations. Organizations can optimize resource use by aligning the right people with the right skills, to the right projects. It also provides a visual representation of resource availability and workload, which makes it easier for project managers to manage and allocate resources.

- **Time and Expense Tracking**

  With the *Time and Expense Tracking* system in Dynamics 365 Project Operations, team members can easily track and submit their time and expenses for approval and billing purposes. Project team members can submit time and expenses from anywhere, using their mobile devices or desktops.

- **Material usage**

  *Material usage* in Dynamics 365 Project Operations supports tasks such as the following list for project managers:  

  - Create purchase orders for materials  

  - Track material deliveries  

  - Manage material inventory levels  

  - Allocate materials to specific tasks or projects  

  - Track material usage and costs at the project level  

- **Subcontracting**

  With Dynamics 365 Project Operations, organizations can manage subcontracting activities within projects such as the following list:  

  - Create and manage subcontractor contracts with vendors  

  - Track subcontractor work  

  - Monitor subcontractor costs  

  - Create subcontractor invoices  

  - Manage subcontractor payments  

- **Project Accounting**

  Project accounting provides essential capabilities such as the following list:  

  - Accurate forecasting  

  - Budgeting and recording of project costs and revenues  

  - Invoicing  

  - Revenue recognition  

  - Compliance  

  - Visibility into key project and overall business health metrics  

- **Microsoft Teams**

  Project teams can improve productivity and collaborate more effectively with Microsoft Teams. The teams can communicate via chat, video, and voice. They can share files within Project Operations, and access project information directly from within Teams.
