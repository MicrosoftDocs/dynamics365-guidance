# Dynamics 365 implementation guidance

Microsoft launched the [Success by Design](success-by-design.md) framework and the [Dynamics 365 implementation guide](introduction.md) a few years ago. We're now consolidating that guidance with other Microsoft Learn content.

## Online guidance

Here on Microsoft Learn, we're gradually publishing more guidance to help our customers successfully implement solutions with Dynamics 365 apps and services. Check the [guidance hub](/dynamics365/guidance/) for new content, and use the navigation panel to find what you're looking for.

- Learn about the guidance hub at [Dynamics 365 guidance overview](../overview.md).
- Rwview the [Dynamics 365 implementation guide](introduction.md).
- Review the [solution architecture design pillars](solution-architecture-design-pillars.md).
- Review the [environment strategy](environment-strategy-overview.md).
- Review the [implementation strategy](implementation-strategy.md).
- Review the [testing strategy](testing-strategy.md).
- Learn how you can [extend your solution](extend-your-solution.md).

The implementation guide represents the collective knowledge and experience of the FastTrack for Dynamics 365 team, gained over thousands of Dynamics 365 implementations. It leads program leaders, project managers, solution architects, system administrators, and business stakeholders on the Dynamics 365 implementation journey, with expert guidance, illustrative case studies, and the thinking, questions, and resources needed for a successful implementation.

## Training

[Free online training](/training/dynamics365) is available for the various roles in an implementation project.
