# Manage service resources overview

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Guides, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist***

The *Manage service resources* area is part of the *Service to cash* end-to-end business process. It explains the area, provides a list of the benefits of using Dynamics 365 to support the process area, and lists the subprocesses within the area.

Within the *Service to cash* end-to-end business process, resources refer to objects that can be scheduled as part of service delivery. The most common schedulable resources are people. However, resources can also refer to other objects such as equipment, facilities, or anything else with capacity limits that must be accounted for in scheduling service delivery activities.

The *Manage service resources* business process area includes the activities needed to set up and maintain the organization's resources. Since resources are needed in the service delivery process, they must be set up in the application before deployment. Plan to identify and define resources during the implementation's discovery and planning stage to ensure you appropriately document your requirements for managing service resources.

Service resources normally require frequent updates, so it's important to recognize that resources must be maintained in the application as part of the ongoing administration and management responsibilities. Plan to assign these responsibilities as part of the initial implementation.

## Stakeholders

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of the *Manage service resources* area. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

- **Operations stakeholders** – Examples: COO

- **Field service stakeholders** – Examples: Service managers, Service supervisors, Dispatchers

- **Billing & Account management stakeholders** – Examples: Director of Finance

### Optimized resource utilization

By effectively managing service resources, organizations can ensure that the right resources are available at the right time, which can help optimize resource utilization and reduce costs.

### Improved service delivery

By having the right resources available at the right time, organizations can improve their service delivery and ensure that customer needs are met in a timely and efficient manner.

### Increased visibility

By having a centralized view of service resources, organizations can gain increased visibility into their resource utilization and identify areas for improvement.
