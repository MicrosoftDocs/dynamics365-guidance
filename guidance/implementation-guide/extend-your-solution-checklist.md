# Extensibility strategy checklist

## Define your extensibility strategy

| Done? | Task |
| :---: | --- |
| &check; | Make sure that you only extend the solution when it empowers users or adds value to the business. |
| &check; | Don't try to copy the same results as the legacy solution or the system you're replacing. |
| &check; | Understand the platform capabilities and use them to simplify and optimize the process. Use the out-of-the-box features as much as possible. |
| &check; | Check if there are any independent software development (ISV) organizations that can meet your needs before you decide to extend the solution. The AppSource marketplace has ISV-managed solutions that might replace the need for a custom solution. |

## Considerations

| Done? | Task |
| :---: | --- |
| &check; | Test how the extensions affect the user experience, responsiveness, performance, and cross-device behavior. |
| &check; | Make sure that the extensions follow the security, privacy, and compliance requirements. |
| &check; | Make sure that the extensions can handle high volume and peak seasons. |
| &check; | Use ALM automated processes to build and deploy the extensions efficiently and quickly. |
| &check; | Use only the documented supported techniques for code and customizations. Don't use deprecated features and techniques. |
