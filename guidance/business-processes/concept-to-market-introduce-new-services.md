This article describes how organizations can use Dynamics 365 to introduce new services.

The ability for an organization to create new services in their offerings plays a pivotal role in the growth and innovation of the organization. The business process area involves strategic development, launch, and integration of fresh offerings into the market, ensuring that the organization remains competitive and responsive to the evolving needs of customers. The process of introducing new offerings into the market can vary drastically from industry to industry and geography to geography, among other factors. However, one certainty among all organizations is that the process can be costly, time consuming, and has a direct impact on the organization's bottom line. For this reason, having strong technology solutions such as Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, and Power Platform are essential to ensure that business decision makers have the right information to make the right decisions.

Organizations can diversify their portfolio, tap into new revenue streams, and strengthen market presence by introducing new services. The Dynamics 365 product suite offers various tools and products to help support this process across several industries. Here are some examples:

- Dynamics 365 Field Service offers capabilities to offer many types of services to organizations.   
- Dynamics 365 Customer Service offers capabilities to support services that are offered to customers.  
- Dynamics 365 Commerce offers capabilities to track sales and services in the point of sale, online, in a call center, or with integrations from Dynamics 365 Sales or other solutions that help you manage your sales cycle.  
- Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management supports the lifecycle of services.   
 
With complex support for different types of services across the portfolio, it's important to select the right technologies to support your business needs.

When introducing new services, it's important to consider that careful execution of the market research, ideation, rigorous testing, and seamless coordination across departments is executed well. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys offers tools to help with many steps. When you use Customer Insights with productivity tools such as Microsoft Teams, Planner, and Outlook, and Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, for example, the organization can successfully implement solutions to support the process leading to increased customer satisfaction, increased brand reputation, and sustainable growth.

When organizations are looking to implement technological solutions to support the introduction of new service business processes, we recommend that these activities are prioritized and planned early in the process. The service data that is captured as part of the business process is critical to many of the downstream processes. A poor implementation might cause data quality issues that can lead to other issues later in the project and in the overall business cycle. Keep in mind that service data is considered master data and should be carefully planned and integrated into all downstream business processes. If you're planning to use a non-Microsoft solution for service master data, you can integrate your solution in the first phases of your service and you can look to replace the non-Microsoft solution in a later phase. However, careful considerations for the functionality needed should be taken early in the project to avoid reworking later.

## Stakeholders 

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of the *Introduce new services* business process area. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

## Introduce new services benefits

There are many key benefits that can be used to monitor and measure the success of implementing technology to support the business processes for introducing new services. The following sections outline the key benefits that an organization might monitor and measure for introducing new services.

### Streamline collaboration and concept development

With Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, you can efficiently capture and categorize new service ideas, ensuring no valuable concepts are overlooked and manage the entire lifecycle of introducing new services. When you use Supply Chain Management with Project Operations and Finance, you can track the costs associated with your projects to introduce new offerings giving you better visibility into the overall process and costs.

Because Dynamics 365 is built on Power Platform, you can easily connect your data to anywhere and out-of-the-box integrations with Microsoft Teams. With Microsoft Outlook, you can streamline collaboration between teams during concept development, allowing stakeholders to refine and shape ideas into viable concepts seamlessly.

Whether you want to use simple tools in the Microsoft 365 suite such as Planner or Microsoft Project, or rich integrated tools like Dynamics 365 Project Operations, you can facilitate coordinated efforts and smooth communication between the departments that are involved in introducing new services. This way, you reduce the risk of delays and miscommunication.

### Efficiently monitor prototyping and testing

With Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, you can efficiently monitor the progress of prototype creation, testing, and feedback gathering, ensuring key stages are managed effectively. With tools to manage projects, and work orders to test service work, it's easy to prototype and test any services that you want to launch.
