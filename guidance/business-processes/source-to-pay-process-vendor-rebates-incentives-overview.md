# Process supplier rebates and incentives

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

This article describes how you can use Dynamics 365 products to support the process for managing supplier or vendor rebates or other incentives in your supply chain.

> [!NOTE]
> In the first versions of the business process catalog, this article represented a business process area, but it is now a business process under *Manage accounts payable*. We're in process of updating the article based on the November 2024 version.

Processing vendor rebates and incentives is a crucial aspect of financial management within an organization, playing a pivotal role in optimizing revenue and strengthening vendor relationships. In the realm of Dynamics 365, particularly Finance and Supply Chain Management, this process is seamlessly integrated, offering a comprehensive solution for managing rebate-related transactions. The cohesive ecosystem of Dynamics 365 ensures that businesses can efficiently configure and execute vendor rebate processes, fostering a streamlined and transparent approach.

The vendor rebate process encompasses several key business processes within Dynamics 365, each contributing to the overall efficiency of managing incentives. This involves configuring a structured vendor rebate approval process, defining diverse rebate programs tailored to specific business needs, and establishing criteria for rebate eligibility. With the capability to generate vendor rebates seamlessly, Dynamics 365 empowers organizations to process and review rebate transactions effortlessly.

The system further enables users to analyze rebate performance comprehensively, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of incentive programs. Through this integrated suite of functionalities, Dynamics 365 ensures that organizations can navigate the complexities of vendor rebate management with precision and effectiveness. The calculation of vendor rebates is determined retrospectively, taking into account both the purchase amount and volume. Furthermore, these rebates are then applied to the respective purchases.

The functionality for rebate management is flexible and can be added at any time even after you're live on Dynamics 365. When you're implementing the functionality for vendor rebates and incentives, it's OK to leave this functionality to a later phase or sprint in an agile approach. The setup and configuration of your products and base pricing along with the general procurement process should be in place before starting the process for rebates and incentives.

## Stakeholders

Many people across the organization should contribute to the decision-making process and design of the *process supplier rebates and incentives* business process area. The following list provides examples of such stakeholders:

- **Finance team stakeholders** include accounts payable specialists, financial analysts, controllers, and chief financial officers (CFOs). These finance team stakeholders play a crucial role in designing and configuring the vendor rebate approval process, defining rebate programs, and analyzing rebate performance. Their expertise ensures the financial accuracy and viability of the incentive programs.

- **Sales and procurement stakeholders** include sales representatives, procurement managers, and category managers. Sales and procurement stakeholders are essential in configuring rebate eligibility and generating vendor rebates. Their input is vital for aligning incentive programs with sales targets and procurement strategies.

- **Supply chain management stakeholders** include supply chain managers, inventory planners, and logistics coordinators. Stakeholders from the supply chain management team contribute to the configuration of vendor rebate approval processes, ensuring alignment with supply chain operations, and optimizing the logistics of rebate-related transactions.

- **Executive leadership stakeholders** include chief executive officers (CEOs), chief operating officers (COOs), and CFOs. Executive leaders should be engaged in high-level decision-making and approval processes, providing strategic direction and oversight to ensure that vendor rebate and incentive programs align with organizational goals and objectives.
