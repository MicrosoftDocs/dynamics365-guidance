# Overview of case to resolution end-to-end business process flow

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights, Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Human Resources, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

This article describes the *case to resolution* end-to-end business process flow and its relationship to other business processes that can be used within Dynamics 365.

## Case to resolution process relationship

The following diagram shows the relationship of other processes and products/features for the *case to resolution* process.

:::image type="content" source="media/case-to-resolution-process.png" alt-text="Business process relationships with upstream and downstream processes that are explained in the next paragraphs." lightbox="media/case-to-resolution-process.png":::

The first column of this diagram shows potential upstream processes for the *case to resolution* process including the following:

- **Acquire to dispose**  

  When cases involve operations with fixed assets or customers assets, the *acquire to dispose* process is upstream to include the process of creating the assets and log asset installations, uninstallations or replacements at owned sites or customer locations.

- **Concept to market**  

  Case investigations may lead to product quality reviews to diagnose service issues that must be addressed in the service development process.

- **Design to retire**  

  Case investigations may lead to product quality reviews to diagnose product issues that must be addressed in the product development process.

- **Hire to retire**  

  In the *hire to retire* process, you use cases to manage employee requests, manager requests, and other back office operations, such as leave, absence, or benefits processes.

- **Inventory to deliver**  

  In any organization that handles tangible products, the *inventory to deliver* process may include cases that are either internal or external in nature. For example, vendor quality, customer issues, or production related cases.

- **Order to cash**  

  The *case to resolution* process can be upstream when you need to create cases related to accounts, sales orders, leads, and so on.

- **Plan to produce**  

  You can use case management with production orders to help manage your production process.

- **Source to pay**  

  The *case to resolution* process can be upstream when you need to create cases related to suppliers, purchase orders, purchase requisitions, requests for quotations, and so on.

- **Project to profit**  

  When you use projects to manage internal or external projects, cases can be a critical part of the process to manage requests and issues.

- **Record to report**  

  Case management can be a critical tool in coordinating resolutions and refund for example, with many other business processes.

- **Service to cash**  

  The *case to resolution* process is often tightly integrated with the *service to cash* process as a tool to help resolve issues with customer assets, products, warranties, and so on.

The second column in the graphic shows the business process areas that are part of the *case to resolution* process.

- Define customer service operations

- Establish a knowledge base

- Engage with customers

- Create a case

- Manage cases

- Work on a case

- Resolve a case

- Analyze case performance

- Process product returns and exchanges

- Process product recalls

The third and last column in the diagram displays the downstream business process including the following the same list that is shown in column one for the upstream processes. This is because there's much flexibility in the process flow your organization can use to manage requests and issues. In some cases, the case may be a prerequisite for completing another process, in others, the case might happen after another process is already complete.

## Featured capabilities

There are product specific capabilities offered that interact with the *case to resolution* to process including, but not limited to, the following:

- **Omnichannel for Customer Service**  

  Allows customers to contact support through multiple channels, streamlining the case resolution process and providing a consistent experience.

- **Nuance Gatekeeper**

## Case to resolution business process flow

The following diagram shows the high-level flow of the *case to resolution* business process. [!INCLUDE [daf-business-process-e2e-flow-def](~/../shared-content/shared/guidance-includes/daf-business-process-e2e-flow-def.md)]

:::image type="content" source="media/case-to-resolution-flow.png" alt-text="inventory to deliver end-to-end process flow diagram" lightbox="media/case-to-resolution-flow.png":::

The following steps are illustrated in the *case to resolution* end-to-end business process flow diagram.

1. Start

2. Case to resolution

3. Define customer service operations

4. Establish a knowledge base

5. Engage with customers

6. Create a case

7. Manage a case

8. Work on a case

    1. Process product return and exchanges

    2. Process product recalls

    3. Inventory to deliver

9. Resolve a case

10. Analyze case performance

11. End

Start has parallel branches to each of the following end-to-end processes (shown on the left side of the diagram)

1. Acquire to dispose

2. Hire to retire

3. Product and service lifecycle management

4. Source to pay

5. Plan to produce

6. Order to cash

7. Prospect to quote

8. Service to cash

9. Record to report

10. Project to profit

Each of these boxes has a branch that connects to 6. Create a case.  

Source to pay, Plan to produce, and Order to cash each have a parallel branch connecting to Inventory to deliver, which also connects to 6. Create a case.

Create a case has parallel branches to each of the end-to-end processes a-j (shown on the right side of the diagram)

Each of the end-to-end processes a-j have parallel branches connecting 7. Manage a case (shown on the right side of the diagram).
