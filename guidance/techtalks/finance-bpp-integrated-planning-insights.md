# TechTalk: Business performance planning with Dynamics 365 Finance

In today's fast-paced business environment, agility and real-time decision-making are crucial to maintaining a competitive edge. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance Business Performance Planning is designed to provide organizations with a comprehensive and connected solution to continuously plan, analyze, and act within their Dynamics ecosystem.

We based this article on [a TechTalk](https://youtu.be/gj0geD3VO7E?si=Hx_O04N5-Xx9uG0g) that you can find online in the Dynamics 365 channel on YouTube.

## A foundation for continuous planning

Dynamics 365 Finance Business Performance Planning enables organizations to move beyond static annual planning toward a dynamic and collaborative model that evolves with the business. As part of the broader Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance suite and built on the Microsoft Power Platform, Business Performance Planning integrates tightly with familiar Microsoft tools and services such as Excel, Power BI, and Microsoft Teams.

This integrated planning solution allows organizations to create budgets, build forecasts, and define strategic plans using familiar interfaces while collaborating seamlessly across teams. Business Performance Planning supports both financial and non-financial planning scenarios, making it versatile enough to span various business units such as finance, human resources, operations, and more.

## Model, connect, collaborate, and act

At the core of Dynamics 365 Finance Business Performance Planning are four key principles: model, connect, collaborate, and act. These principles serve as the backbone of the planning experience.

The modeling layer allows users to define business drivers, organizational hierarchies, and time dimensions, enabling the configuration of planning processes that reflect real-world complexity. The connection layer ties Business Performance Planning to the Dynamics 365 ecosystem and Microsoft Dataverse, enabling real-time data integration and ensuring that planning activities are based on current and trusted information.

Collaboration is central to Business Performance Planning. With embedded workflows, approval processes, and real-time data sharing, teams across departments can work together without needing to manually consolidate plans or jump between systems. Once plans are finalized or simulations are compared, organizations can act immediately using insights to drive decisions or trigger automated processes through the Power Platform.

## Built for financial and operational planning

One of the defining strengths of Dynamics 365 Finance Business Performance Planning is its ability to handle both financial and operational planning use cases. The solution supports a wide range of planning needs including budgeting, forecasting, headcount planning, compensation modeling, cost allocation, and more.

Users can perform what-if scenario analysis to understand how changes in one area may impact financial outcomes across the organization. For example, an HR leader can project future headcount needs and compensation increases, while a finance manager can immediately visualize how those changes affect the company's overall budget and profitability. This capability is facilitated by seamless integration with Power BI visualizations and Excel-based planning templates.

The flexibility of the platform allows organizations to begin with top-down strategic planning while also supporting bottom-up inputs from individual teams or departments. Calculated KPIs, simulation comparisons, and robust version control help streamline planning cycles and reduce the time and effort involved in traditional budgeting processes.

## Demonstration of key features

During the TechTalk presentation, several practical scenarios were demonstrated to highlight the key capabilities of Dynamics 365 Finance Business Performance Planning. These included workforce planning, cost modeling, and the use of calculated forecast logic for real-time scenario exploration.

Templates were shown as a way to simplify complex configuration tasks. These templates can be used to quickly build out planning structures and ensure consistency across the organization. Users can input values manually or rely on formulas and logic to drive forecasts automatically. Each user interaction feeds back into the system's real-time view, eliminating the need for disconnected spreadsheets or external reports.

With native integrations to Power BI and Excel, decisionmakers can immediately assess the impact of changes using interactive dashboards or flexible pivot-based reports. The transparency and speed of this experience drastically improve the quality of conversations and decisions across teams.

## Future enhancements and roadmap

Microsoft is committed in expanding the capabilities of Dynamics 365 Finance Business Performance Planning. Key areas of focus include enhancing AI-driven forecasting, strengthening support for operational planning use cases, and embedding more functionality directly into Microsoft Teams to make planning more conversational and collaborative.

Other roadmap priorities include improved support for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics, and the integration of advanced analytics tools to provide more predictive and prescriptive insights. These planned enhancements reflect Microsoft's commitment to evolving Business Performance Planning in response to customer feedback and changing market demands.
