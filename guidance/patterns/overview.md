# What are patterns in Dynamics 365 solutions?

Dynamics 365 supports a wide range of business solutions. Different scenarios, across different industries, often use the same basic patterns.  

In this set of articles, we've identified some of the patterns we've seen that admins and consultants have used to bring for Dynamics 365 solutions to life. Each article contains high-level procedures and links to docs and training.

In the list below, look for a scenario that's similar to what you need and then select the pattern to learn more.

We'll continue to add patterns over time in collaboration with the Dynamics 365 community. Learn more about contributions to patterns at [Contribute to Dynamics 365 guidance content](/dynamics365/get-started/contribute#dynamics-365-guidance-content).  

## Established patterns

The following table lists the already established patterns.
