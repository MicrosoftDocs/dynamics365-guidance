# Checklist for your training strategy

## Implementation

| Done? | Task |
|---|---|
| &check; | Have training objectives that are SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely). Make them relevant to your organization's goal of user adoption, and make them fit the organization's overall change management goals. |
| &check; | Have a process for incrementally updating the training plan as necessary to reflect scope, changes, risks, and dependencies, to ensure adoption and engagement. |
| &check; | Consider what to include as far as system processes and business processes, so that the training provides the best possible foundation to system users. |
| &check; | Clearly define the match between personas and roles, and between business processes and the user level for each training session, so that users receive relevant training. |
| &check; | Ensure that the training schedule accounts for key project milestones, resource requirements and availability, dates, and tasks, and that it's aligned with the overall project plan. |
| &check; | Consider several types of content, the time to create it, and the effort to deliver and maintain it. Cover how you store the content, and the skill set of the authors and trainers. |
| &check; | Set up the training environment with realistic data, user profiles, and scenarios. Refresh and clean it after training sessions to maintain quality. |
| &check; | Ensure that trainers and super users are trained well in advance of system user training. Ideally, this training should occur before user acceptance testing (UAT). |
| &check; | Ensure that the training plan appropriately addresses accessibility. |
| &check; | Define a process for feedback and continuous improvements to training materials. |
| &check; | Identify a process to provide for continuous training in alignment with Microsoft updates and changes to the solution, and also with changes in roles and responsibilities. |
