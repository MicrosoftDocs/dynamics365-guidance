# Drive loyalty and growth with the manage customer relationships business process area

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Customer Voice***

This article provides an overview of using Dynamics 365 to manage customer relationships and drive loyalty and growth. Strong customer relationship management requires collaboration across Sales, Service, Marketing, and Operations to maximize customer lifetime value.

Effective customer relationship management starts when Sales classifies and documents new customer accounts. Prospects can be nurtured so that they become clients. Sales is also responsible for structuring customer hierarchies to represent organizational relationships. Account managers and cross-functional teams are assigned to manage key accounts and develop growth strategies.

As customers begin engaging, Customer Service provides ongoing support across channels such as email, chat, phone, and in person. Service agents have access to the full customer history and can therefore deliver personalized experiences. Marketing creates segmented customer journeys to guide customers through educational touchpoints. Operations fulfills orders and returns.

Throughout the customer lifecycle, teams track satisfaction metrics and loyalty through surveys and interaction analysis. This data helps identify upsell opportunities and prevent churn. Dynamics 365 empowers teams to work together seamlessly and gain unified visibility into all customer interactions. Proactive relationship management is vital for maximizing lifetime value, profitability, and traceability.
