# Administer system features overview  

***Applies to: Dynamics 365***  

This article provides an overview of the *administer system features* business process area within the *administer to operate* end-to-end scenario in Dynamics 365 apps. Learn how to effectively manage, configure, and optimize essential system capabilities to streamline operations, automate processes, and integrate with Microsoft tools and external systems.

*Feature management* is a powerful tool that allows organizations to manage and configure features in their Dynamics 365 environment. For finance and operations apps such as Finance or Supply Chain Management, use the [Feature management workspace](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview). This tool provides a centralized location for administrators to enable or disable features, ensuring that the system is tailored to meet the specific needs of the organization. Staying up to date with Microsoft release notes is crucial, as it helps organizations stay informed about new features, updates, and improvements. The feature management workspace allows administrators to easily configure and roll out new functionalities, providing better control and oversight. It also provides insights into feature usage and adoption, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions about which features to implement and prioritize. By using the [Feature management workspace](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview), organizations can enhance their operational efficiency, improve user experience, and ensure that their Dynamics 365 environment is optimized for success.  

The importance of this business process area lies in its ability to support system-wide functionality, ensuring that the right features, configurations, and tools are in place for both internal users and external stakeholders. From workflow automation to mobile app management, the processes outlined help drive operational efficiency, reduce manual intervention, and improve the user experience. Properly managing these features ensures that the organization can use the full power of Dynamics 365 and other connected technologies.  

Define this business process area early in the overall implementation of Dynamics 365, such as during the planning and design phases. Defining this area early ensures that system features are configured appropriately from the start, avoiding costly adjustments later in the implementation process. It's especially critical when organizations aim to integrate multiple tools or optimize for specific workflows across various departments, such as finance, sales, and customer service.  

In this article, we explore the business processes within this area. We look at workflow configuration, file storage management, mobile app integration, IoT device handling, and more. Each process is discussed in detail, providing insights into how they contribute to the overall system functionality and business success.  

## Stakeholders  

Effective administration of system features in Dynamics 365 requires collaboration from key stakeholders to ensure proper configuration, management, and alignment with organizational goals. These stakeholders play a vital role in optimizing system capabilities for business efficiency and security.

1. **Executive Leadership (CEOs, CFOs, CIOs)**: Executive leadership provides strategic oversight for the administration of system features, ensuring that the features align with broader organizational objectives. They guide resource allocation and ensure that system configurations support business continuity, security, and resilience.  
1. **IT Management (CIOs, IT Directors, IT Managers)**: IT management is essential in the practical implementation and maintenance of system features. They handle the integration of IT resources, including cloud-based services, mobile apps, and security configurations, to ensure seamless operation and system performance. Their role is crucial in aligning technical features with the overall IT strategy.  
1. **System Administrators**: System administrators play a key role in configuring and managing the various features within Dynamics 365. They ensure workflows, mobile apps, reporting tools, and other features are set up correctly. They also monitor and maintain system performance, addressing any technical issues as they arise.  
1. **Solution Architects**: Solution architects design the system architecture and make sure that it aligns with the organization's business processes. They configure features based on the business needs of different departments, ensuring the system functions cohesively and meets long-term objectives.  
1. **Business Process Owners/Functional Leads**: Business process owners and functional leads define the business requirements for system features. They ensure that workflows, reporting tools, and other features align with the specific needs of their departments and drive operational efficiency.  
1. **Data Protection Officers (DPOs)/Privacy Officers**: These stakeholders ensure that data privacy and protection measures are in place, with compliance with relevant privacy laws. They oversee data protection strategies and collaborate with legal and compliance teams to ensure the system features meet regulatory standards.  
1. **Security Officers/Information Security Managers**: Information security managers and security officers are responsible for overseeing the protection of system features from potential security threats. They work on developing security policies, conducting risk assessments, and ensuring that the system features are secure from unauthorized access or vulnerabilities.  
1. **Quality Assurance (QA) and Testing Team**: The QA and testing team plays a crucial role in validating the performance and security of system features. They rigorously test features, including workflows and reporting tools, to ensure that all functionalities meet quality standards and regulatory compliance requirements.  
1. **Internal Auditors/Audit Committee**: Internal auditors and audit committee members assess the effectiveness of system configurations and ensure that security measures and other system features comply with governance and risk management practices. They provide an independent review and suggest improvements to ensure ongoing compliance and performance.  

When the implementation project involves these stakeholders, it's more likely that system features in Dynamics 365 are configured, secured, and managed effectively, driving productivity while maintaining compliance with legal and organizational requirements.  

## Administer system features process flow  

Explore the *administer system features* process flow in the following diagram to understand key steps for configuring and managing system capabilities.

:::image type="content" source="media/administer-to-operate-administer-system-features-flow.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows the Administer business process flow." lightbox="media/administer-to-operate-administer-system-features-flow.svg":::  

The following steps are shown in the *administer business process* flow diagram:

1. Start  
1. *Administer to operate*
1. *Administer system features*

    1. *Configure and administer workflows*  

        Start by configuring and setting up workflows as the core of automated business processes in Dynamics 365.  
    1. *Configure, monitor, and send emails*  

        Once workflows are in place, set up email notifications, alerts, and communication strategies triggered by the workflows.  
    1. *Manage file storage*  

        Manage the storage and organization of files that can be linked to workflows, emails, and documents.  
    1. *Configure and monitor system-generated numbers*  

        Establish the numbering system for document generation, such as invoice numbers, order IDs, etc.  

    1. *Configure and maintain cloud-based printing*  
    1. *Configure and maintain electronically generated documents*
