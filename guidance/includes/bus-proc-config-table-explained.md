The following table shows the configurations available, and the sequence recommended for setting up the configurations from top to bottom. Use the links in the **Process step** column to learn more about the component. The **Process stage** column includes three values that are separated by semi colons (;). The first value indicates *the project phase* when a configuration or step should be completed. The second value indicates *the type of configuration*, and the third value indicates if the step is *a configuration* or *an operational step*. The **Process modifiers** column is used to further describe other attributes for each step. The **Application: Navigation and Entity** column uses abbreviations to indicate the user interface or application with the navigation path after the colon. First, we list the navigation to the relevant forms. Next comes the name of the entity for importing or exporting data in either the Dataverse (*DV*) or with Data Management Framework (*DMF*). We use the abbreviations to indicate the type of entity, followed by the name of the entity after the colon.
