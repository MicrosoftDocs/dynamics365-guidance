In Dynamics 365 Sales, several experiences tailored for sales are prebuilt to give customers a head start when designing their sales apps. They're also designed to accelerate sales engagement and improved by feedback from many customers. So before building custom pages or components, evaluate the OOB controls â€“ these are configurable so you can tailor the UI to the specific needs of your sellers.

## Pipeline view

*Pipeline view* in Dynamics 365 Sales helps the seller to visualize the entire sales pipeline while allowing them to manage it. It contains charts that assist the seller to visualize the sales pipeline and prioritize the most impactful deal, or the deal that is closest to completion.  

With pipeline view, the seller can simply select an opportunity in the chart to update key information, add notes, or create tasks. This improves seller efficiency by avoiding unnecessary navigation and lost context.  

KPIs in Pipeline View helps the seller understand the sales pipeline on aggregate level such as how many opportunities, total value of the pipeline, average deal size, and so on. The metrics can be adjusted to the sellers' needs ensuring the right view of KPIs you want the seller to track.  

The pipeline view experience can also be personalized to fit the sales scenarios better. Many personalization options are available to the seller in the workspace and the system administrator can also influence what the pipeline view includes and shows.  

Sellers always ask for great sales dashboards, simplicity in opportunity updates, and a way to manage opportunities while staying in the context of the sales pipeline. Pipeline view combines both great visualization of the sales pipeline with the ability to update opportunities, making it a tailored workspace for the seller.  

The recommendation is for any new sales implementation project to test, assess, and consider Pipeline View as part of requirement grooming.

- You can update the forecast data manually or automatically, and schedule the forecast model to run at regular intervals.
