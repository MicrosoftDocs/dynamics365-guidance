# Design a solution architecture that works for you

Before you start building a solution, you need to be clear about what you want to achieve and how you'll get there. Otherwise, you might end up with a costly and ineffective outcome.

In this article and related articles, we'll show you how to use the solution architecture design pillars and the Success by Design framework to create a blueprint for a successful solution with Dynamics 365 apps.

## What are solution architecture design pillars?

Solution architecture is a systematic approach to designing a solution that meets your needs and goals. It involves identifying the essential elements of your solution and how they fit together.

Think of solution architecture as a way of turning your vision into a plan. You start with a clear idea of what you want to achieve, then you map out the steps and resources you need to make it happen. Along the way, you consider and manage the risks and dependencies that might affect your solution.

A solution architect is someone who guides and oversees the solution architecture process. They work with the business and IT teams to understand the requirements, scope, and budget of the project. They also create and maintain the blueprint of the solution, ensuring that it meets the quality standards and expectations of the stakeholders.

## How to design your solution architecture

The first step to designing your solution architecture is to define your vision. Your vision is the big picture of what you want to achieve with your solution. It should be aligned with your business strategy and goals.

The next step is to outline your business processes. Your business processes are the activities and tasks that your solution supports or enables. They should be mapped to your vision and optimized for efficiency and effectiveness.

Then, you need to determine how people are connected in and around your organization. Your people are the users and stakeholders of your solution. They should be identified, engaged, and empowered by your solution.

After that, you need to know your data. Your data is the information that your solution collects, stores, and analyzes. It should be relevant, accurate, and secure.

Finally, you need to develop a solution strategy using technology and tools. Your solution strategy is the plan that describes how you'll use Dynamics 365 apps and other technologies to build and implement your solution. It should be aligned with your solution architecture and best practices.

The following diagram summarizes the solution architecture design pillars and how they relate to your vision.
