# Checklist for application lifecycle management

| Done? | Task |
| :--: | -- |
| &check; | Set up your ALM strategy at the start of your project. Align your ALM strategy with your environments, source control, implementation methodology, and automation strategy. |
| &check; | Make sure your ALM strategy is efficient, reliable, robust, and automated. Your ALM strategy should let you deploy your configurations and customizations smoothly across different environments, including any peripheral solution components. |
| &check; | Use a source control-centric approach for your ALM strategy. Source control helps you create new environments with the latest configurations without having to replicate existing environments. |
| &check; | Use build automation and a CI/CD pipeline for your project. Build automation and a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline help you streamline your development and deployment processes. |
| &check; | Consider your implementation team's structure. Your team structure should allow for effective collaboration and give developers exclusive control where needed. |
| &check; | Follow best practices for ALM and for each app. Download the white paper [Solution Lifecycle Management: Dynamics 365](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57777) to learn more about ALM best practices and recommendations for each Dynamics 365 app. |
