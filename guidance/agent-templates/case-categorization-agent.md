# Case Categorization & Enrichments Agent

Eliminates manual data entry and reduces case handling time by automatically extracting information from customer interactions and intelligently populating case fields with AI-predicted values. This can automatically categorize the cases so they are routed to the correct team, eliminating the need for a manual triage or passing back and forth between teams.

## Overview

Leverages generative AI to automatically extract, predict, and populate case field values from conversations and emails. Analyzes semantic context from chat transcripts, voice calls, and email content to intelligently categorize cases. Administrators configure prediction fields and conditional rules. Enrichment occurs when representatives accept conversations, during interactions, at conversation end, and when emails arrive.

## Key benefits

- Automated case field population (type, priority, category, product, custom fields)
- Reduced manual data entry and administrative tasks
- Intelligent lookup resolution with hierarchical relationships
- Real-time enrichment during conversations and from emails
- Conditional rule-based updates based on case attributes
