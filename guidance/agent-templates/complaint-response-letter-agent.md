# Generate Customer Response Letter Agent

Automates complaint First Response Letter (FRL) generation, reducing drafting time by 70%. For organizations processing 60,000+ complaints annually, saves approximately 1,700 working days (42,000 hours), allowing complaint handlers to focus on resolution rather than administrative tasks.

## Overview

Generative AI agent automatically drafts First Response Letters by extracting and synthesizing investigation findings, activities, and actions documented in Dynamics 365 complaint cases. Combines verbatim details (dates, facts, findings) with AI-generated narrative explaining resolution steps and outcomes. Complaint handlers review, adjust, and approve drafts before customer delivery.
