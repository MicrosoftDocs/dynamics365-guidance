# Import data for vendor invoices in Dynamics 365 projects

***Applies to: Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management, Dynamics 365 Project Operations, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management***

You can use data entities to import data for vendor invoices in Dynamics 365 projects, such as for data migration or integration scenarios. This article outlines the contexts and use cases with links to the relevant entities.  

## Context and problem

Use the **Vendor invoice header** and **Vendor invoice line** entities to import vendor invoices with the most typical fields.

Vendor invoices can also have charges and attachments that must be imported. The **Vendor invoice charges** and **Vendor invoice document attachment V2** entities have a dependency on the vendor invoice header. The **Vendor invoice line charges** entity has a dependency on the vendor invoice line.

## Entities
