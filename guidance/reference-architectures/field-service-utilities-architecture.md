# Scalable field service management for utility projects

***Applies to***: ***Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Power Automate, Power Apps, Power Pages, Dataverse, Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions***

This solution combines Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Power Platform, and Azure Integration Services to build an advanced field service management solution. It includes components that let citizens follow a field service project for installing fiber optic cables at a large scale.

## Introduction

This solution optimizes service delivery and reduces escalations. It increases operational efficiency by automating workflows and integrating with external systems from government and utility companies.

The primary objectives of this architecture are:

- Improve field service management through optimized scheduling and resource allocation.
- Enhance customer experience with a self-service portal and omnichannel communication.
- Provide scalability and flexibility for future expansion and integration with more services.
- Enable data-driven decision making with advanced analytics and AI-driven insights.

## Architecture

The following diagram shows the solution architecture. It's based on a specific implementation and includes the names of non-Microsoft products that aren't covered in this article.

The solution uses a cloud architecture built on Dynamics 365, Azure Integration Services, and Power Platform. It follows a loosely coupled design to reduce dependencies and increase flexibility. The architecture has these main components:

- Core business applications that manage service requests, case handling, and customer engagement efficiently
  - Dynamics 365 Field Service
  - Dynamics 365 Customer Service
  - Dynamics 365 Customer Insights

- Integration layer in Azure Integration Services that lets secure data exchange between internal and external systems. This layer ensures real-time updates and seamless interactions between Dynamics 365, external company applications, and custom-built applications.

- Self-service portal built with Power Pages so customers can interact with the system independently. Customers can schedule service appointments, track request status, and access historical maintenance and repair records.

- Data and analytics with Power BI that gives insights into field operations and customer interactions. It offers a centralized dashboard for operational monitoring, tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), and trend analysis to drive continuous improvement.

## Stakeholders

Key stakeholders in this process are:

- Operations team oversees field service operations, ensuring efficient scheduling and dispatching.
- Field technicians carry out service tasks and report work progress by using the Field Service Mobile App.
- Customers (citizens or civilians) use the self-service portal to schedule, track requests, and access service history.
- Government utility company is an external entity that distributes work orders and manages escalations when customer contact doesn't work.
- Implementation partner manages technical implementation and integration of Dynamics 365.
- IT and system admins take care of infrastructure security, compliance, and smooth integrations.
- Customer service team handles inquiries, escalations, and coordinates service requests.
- Business and data analysts use Power BI to optimize resource allocation and efficiency.

## Workflow

The following image shows the system workflow for work order import, customer journey, scheduling, technician execution, and reporting. The image is hard to read, so refer to the description after the image.

The system workflow uses a structured *Work Order-to-Service* process with automated handovers at each stage. This process lets you move from initial customer interaction to service completion, while keeping traceability and compliance.

1. Import work orders from the utility company into Dynamics 365 using Azure Functions and Azure Service Bus to ensure seamless data integration.
1. Start a customer journey to validate availability, present appointment options, and collect additional details as needed. The customer journey follows these steps:

    - Customer notification: Customers receive an email or SMS notifying them about the required service.
    - Appointment selection: The customer is provided with a self-service link where they can choose a preferred appointment slot.
    - Reminder and confirmation: Automated reminders are sent ahead of the appointment to reduce no-shows.
    - Other data collection: Customers can upload relevant documents or provide further details related to the service request.
    - No contact path: If the customer doesn't respond after multiple contact attempts, the system escalates to Fluvius and puts the work order on hold or reassigns it.

1. Schedule and dispatch technicians automatically by using AI-driven scheduling that considers availability, location, and skills.
1. Technicians do the work, log updates, capture images, and submit reports by using the Field Service mobile app.
1. Record completion and collect customer feedback by using Customer Insights and Customer Voice surveys.
1. Analyze performance data and generate Power BI reports to improve operational strategies and optimize resource use.

## Components

The architecture uses the following components.

- Dynamics 365 Field Service

  - Manage and dispatch work orders
  - Use AI to predict maintenance needs
  - Use a mobile app for technicians

- Dynamics 365 Customer Service

  - Manage cases based on SLAs
  - Communicate with customers in one place
  - Integrate with external request portals

- Power Pages

  - Schedule appointments through self-service
  - Track machines using QR codes
  - Submit and track service requests

- Azure Integration Services

  - Centralize and streamline integration endpoints with API Management
  - Distribute load and enable event-driven messaging with Azure Service Bus
  - Run complex business logic with Azure Functions and Logic Apps

- Data and analytics

  - Monitor in real time with Power BI dashboards
  - Optimize resource use with AI-driven insights

## Scenario details

This solution supports a field service installation company that wins a major government contract with a utility company. The company installs a national fiber optic cable network. It gets work orders from the utility company, contacts citizens, plans work orders, installs fiber optic cables, and reports back to the utility company.

The architecture supports different field service scenarios where work orders come from an external service provider. This approach gives flexibility and adapts to changing business needs. Each scenario uses AI, automation, and cloud capabilities to improve service efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Potential use cases

- Preventive maintenance scheduling  

  AI-driven predictive analytics schedule maintenance activities before issues arise, reduce downtime, and increase asset longevity.
- Field technician efficiency  

  Real-time location tracking and optimized routing let technicians complete more tasks in less time and reduce travel costs.
- Customer self-service  

  Customers manage their own service requests, reschedule appointments, and access historical maintenance records, which increases transparency and reduces customer support workload.
- Automated work order processing  

  Integration between customer service requests and field service work orders eliminates manual intervention and ensures service requests are handled promptly and accurately.

## Considerations

These considerations help implement a solution that includes Dynamics 365. Learn more at [Dynamics 365 guidance documentation](../index.yml).

When implementing this architecture, take the following factors into account:

- Scalability  

    The system supports expansion to accommodate new use cases and integrate other services.
- Security & compliance  

    Use a robust security framework, including role-based access control (RBAC), encryption, and compliance with industry standards like ISO 27001 and GDPR.
- System performance  

    Run regular load testing and performance monitoring to maintain optimal response times and service availability.
- User training and adoption  

    Make sure both field technicians and customers are well trained on the system's features to maximize efficiency and user satisfaction.
