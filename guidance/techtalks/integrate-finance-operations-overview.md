# TechTalk: Integration patterns for Dynamics 365 finance and operations applications

Are you embarking on a journey through the intricate world of Dynamics 365 finance and operations applications? This article delves into the diverse integration patterns available. It offers clarity and direction for businesses and developers navigating the realm of these advanced applications.

We've based this article on [a TechTalk](https://youtu.be/tUMEZlEKjEQ?si=v2IXcIMQ4bW2rHQd) that you can find online in the Dynamics 365 channel on YouTube.

In the realm of Dynamics 365, synchronous integrations stand out for their ability to provide real-time data exchanges. Key to these integrations is the OData RESTful Web Service, widely used for standard integrations such as the Excel Add-in. This service functions as an abstraction layer, enabling Create, Read, Update, Delete operations, and business logic actions. Alongside this, Custom Services play a crucial role, particularly in transitioning from older Dynamics versions. These services, available in SOAP/XML and RESTful/JSON formats, cater to the need for real-time data interaction.

## The world of asynchronous integrations

Asynchronous integrations in Dynamics 365 cater to scenarios where immediate response isn't critical, mainly handling large data volumes. The Data Management Framework (DMF) within these applications offers robust tools for both data import and export. This framework supports various data formats and protocols, making it a versatile choice for asynchronous data handling. Complementing the DMF is the Events Framework, which enables applications to react to various triggers through business and data events. This framework is integral in orchestrating efficient integration across various business processes.

## Hybrid solutions and advanced services

Beyond the standard integration patterns, Dynamics 365 finance and operations also embrace hybrid solutions. These solutions blend the functionalities of on-premises systems with cloud capabilities, offering a comprehensive approach to modern business needs. Furthermore, advanced services like Azure Synapse Link enhance the integration capabilities, especially in areas such as analytics and data warehousing. Such services are instrumental in facilitating a seamless flow of information across different platforms and systems.

## Conclusion

The integration patterns within Dynamics 365 finance and operations are a testament to the application's versatility and capability to address specific business needs. From facilitating real-time interactions to managing extensive data sets, these patterns ensure a seamless and efficient operational workflow. For those seeking in-depth guidance and insights, the Dynamics 365 TechTalk community page serves as a valuable resource, complete with detailed explanations and demonstrations.
