# Extensibility strategy checklist

Use this article to help you define and track your extensibility strategy.

## Define your extensibility strategy

- Check that all requirements to extend the solution are driven by the need to empower users or bring more value to the business.

- Ensure the solution doesn't mimic the ways of achieving the same results as the legacy solution or the system being replaced.

- Understand the platform capabilities and use its strength to simplify and optimize the overall process to get most of the out-of-the-box experiences.

- Review if the implementation project considered any independent software development organizations (ISV) before deciding to extend the solution. The AppSource marketplace contains ISV-managed solutions that may replace the need to create a custom solution.

## Considerations

- Validate that the extensions don't negatively impact the user experience, responsiveness, performance, and how the solution behaves across different devices and platforms as part of the organization test strategy.

- Ensure the extensions honor the security mechanism, privacy, and compliance requirements.

- Ensure extensions are scalable, tested for high volume, and capable of handling peaks like holiday seasons.

- Align extensions with ALM automated processes to build and deploy them in an efficient and fast-paced manner.

- Ensure code and customizations follow only the documented supported techniques, and don't use deprecated features and techniques.
